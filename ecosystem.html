        <h1>Ecosystem: Flora and Fauna</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Flora System</h2>
        <h3>General Rules</h3>
        <p>Almost all surviving plants are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bioluminescent</li>
            <li>Carnivorous or parasitic</li>
            <li>Chemical-based feeders</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most plants are active, not passive.</p>
        <p>The world follows a basic truth:</p>
        <blockquote><em>The more beautiful the plant, the more dangerous it is</em>.</blockquote>
        <h3>Known Flora</h3>
        <p><strong>Sweetbreath Traps</strong><br>Plants that release hypnotic fragrance. Victims feel calm, peaceful, and euphoric. Roots sense falling vibrations and gently pull unconscious bodies underground.</p>
        <p><strong>Graveblossoms</strong><br>Flowers that grow from dead wood. They feed on decay and emit soft silver, pale blue, or violet glow.</p>
        <p><strong>Wellsap Vines</strong><br>Water-producing plants that collect moisture and condense it into drinkable liquid. Some variants are safe. Others contain slow poisons.</p>
        <p><strong>Glassleaf Shrubs</strong><br>Transparent leaves that cut skin when brushed against. They refract biolight into beautiful patterns to lure prey.</p>
        <p><strong>Pulse Moss</strong><br>A carpet-like moss that expands and contracts like breathing. It can shift the ground over time and slowly swallow fallen objects.</p>
        <p><strong>Memory Reeds</strong><br>Tall, thin plants that release faint whispering sounds when touched. Some believe they store echoes of past events.</p>
        <p><strong>Corpse Lanterns</strong><br>Fungus that grows on buried skeletons and glows stronger the more bone it touches.</p>

        <h2>Fauna System</h2>
        <h3>General Rules</h3>
        <p>Most creatures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rely on echolocation</li>
            <li>Use scent trails</li>
            <li>Produce their own light</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Eyes are often reduced or replaced by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat sensing pits</li>
            <li>Sound receptors</li>
            <li>Vibrational whiskers</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Known and Expanded Fauna</h3>
        <p><strong>Bulbskulls</strong><br>Small survival creatures with oversized storage heads.</p>
        <p><strong>Echo-Wings</strong><br>Bat-like armored fliers with sonar-based navigation.</p>
        <p><strong>Beacon Tailed Wanderers</strong><br>Snake or lizard-like creatures that glow along their bodies.</p>
        <p><strong>Drift Hunters</strong><br>Jellyfish-like floating creatures in the air that pulse dim light and sting prey.</p>
        <p><strong>Shardback Beasts</strong><br>Thick-skinned animals with crystal growths on their backs that naturally glow.</p>
        <p><strong>Hollow Howlers</strong><br>Blind quadrupeds that sense air pressure and movement. Their calls disorient prey.</p>
        <p><strong>Rootleeches</strong><br>Worm-like creatures that live in plant root systems and drink sap or blood.</p>
