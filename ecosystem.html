        <h1>Ecosystem of Evershade</h1>
        <hr>
        
        <h2>A World Transformed</h2>
        <p>In the wake of the Stilling, the event that froze the sun and plunged the world into perpetual twilight, the natural world has undergone radical transformation. What remains is an ecosystem unlike anything that existed before: a realm where bioluminescence has replaced sunlight, where plants hunt and glow, and where creatures navigate by sound and chemical traces rather than sight.</p>
        
        <p>The ecosystem of Evershade is a testament to life's relentless adaptability. In the absence of solar energy, organisms have evolved entirely new methods of survival. Plants no longer photosynthesize in the traditional sense, instead, they feed on decay, chemical processes, and each other. Animals have abandoned their eyes in favor of echolocation, thermal sensing, and vibrational awareness. Every living thing in this world emits light, absorbs light, or follows light.</p>
        
        <p>This is a dangerous beauty. The more vibrant and alluring a plant appears, the more likely it is to be deadly. The softest glow may hide the sharpest trap. Yet within this harsh environment, delicate balances have emerged, symbiotic relationships, migration patterns, and cycles of life that sustain both the land and the scattered human settlements that cling to survival.</p>
        
        <p>The ecosystem operates on a simple truth: <strong><em>nothing here remembers the sun, but everything carries its ghost.</em></strong></p>

        <h2>The New Ecosystem</h2>
        <p>The natural world adapted to perpetual twilight in radical ways. Without sunlight, life evolved entirely new survival strategies:</p>
        
        <h3>Plant Adaptations</h3>
        <p><strong>Plants</strong> no longer rely on photosynthesis. Instead, they:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Emit their own bioluminescent light in vibrant colors</li>
            <li>Feed on decay, chemicals, or other organisms</li>
            <li>Actively hunt using traps, toxins, and lures</li>
            <li>Respond to movement, warmth, and vibrations</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Animal Adaptations</h3>
        <p><strong>Animals</strong> abandoned traditional sight-based hunting. They evolved:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Echolocation for navigation in darkness</li>
            <li>Heat-sensing organs to detect warm-blooded prey</li>
            <li>Bioluminescent communication signals</li>
            <li>Chemical sensing to track food and danger</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Fundamental Rule</h3>
        <p>The wilderness of Evershade operates on a dangerous principle: <strong><em>The more beautiful something appears, the more dangerous it is.</em></strong></p>
        
        <p>Glowing plants with stunning colors often emit toxic spores. Creatures that shine brightest are frequently the deadliest predators. In this world, beauty is a warning sign, not an invitation.</p>
        
        <p>Yet within this harsh environment, delicate balances have emerged. Symbiotic relationships, migration patterns, and nutrient cycles sustain both the land and the scattered human settlements. Life persists, transformed but resilient, carrying the ghost of the sun it no longer remembers.</p>

        <h2>Survival Principles</h2>
        <p>Those who travel through Evershade's wilderness live by certain rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Trust your other senses</strong> - Sight can deceive in the dim glow. Listen, smell, and feel.</li>
            <li><strong>Beautiful means dangerous</strong> - The brightest blooms are often the deadliest.</li>
            <li><strong>Follow the migrations</strong> - The Beacon-Tailed and other migratory species know the safe paths.</li>
            <li><strong>Respect the darkness</strong> - Not all things that glow are friendly, but total darkness means something has consumed all the light.</li>
            <li><strong>Never harm the keystone species</strong> - Bulbskulls, Beacon-Tailed, and certain plants maintain the delicate balance. Disturbing them brings misfortune.</li>
        </ul>
