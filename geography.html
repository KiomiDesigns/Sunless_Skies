        <h1>Geography and Locations</h1>
        <img src="My documents/Images/Map.png" alt="Evershade Map" style="width:500px; display:block; margin:20px auto;">

        <h2>Landscapes & Regions</h2>
        
        <h4>Glowforest Expanse</h4>
        <img src="My documents/Images/Glowforest.png" alt="Glowforest" style="width:300px; float:right; margin:10px;">
        <p>A sprawling woodland where every surface gives off some amount of glow, soft, shimmering, or pulsing. The canopy above is made of bioluminescent leaves that sway with slow, almost rhythmic motion, creating the illusion of drifting lights in the sky. Most illumination comes from fungal pillars that wrap around tree trunks like spiraling lanterns, their glow fluctuating in steady "breaths."</p>
        <p>Travel through the Glowforest is disorienting; the light refuses to cast shadows, so depth perception is unreliable. Some trees emit faint melodic hums when touched by wind, and many plants react to movement, folding, dimming, or brightening depending on whether they perceive a threat.</p>
        <p>Predators hide in plain sight, blending into light patterns. For this reason, the Glowforest is known as both the most beautiful and the most deceptive biome. Its glow is a lure as much as a guide. Old paths shift as pulse moss and root systems subtly reshape the forest floor over time.</p>
        
        <h4>Crystal Hollows</h4>
        <img src="My documents/Images/Crystal Hollows.png" alt="Crystal Hollows" style="width:300px; float:right; margin:10px 10px 10px 30px;">
        <p>These immense caverns span deep beneath the land, formed around natural veins of bioluminescent crystal. Their glow is colder and sharper than forest light, yellowish-white, refracted endlessly through jagged formations. The air here feels still, as sound echoes unnaturally far and lingers longer than expected.</p>
        <p>Travelers describe the hollows as "alive," not because of creatures, but because the crystals themselves seem reactive. Footsteps vibrate through the crystalline ground, causing faint flickers of light that ripple outward. Some areas pulse like a dim heartbeat, aligned with shifts in subterranean pressure.</p>
        <p>The Deepstone Cities carve their territory into the edges of the hollows, using the crystal's natural luminescence and resonant properties. Over-mining is avoided; the crystals are believed to weaken or "go dark" when over-harvested. Cartographers struggle to map the region because tunnels change as root systems from above break through cavern ceilings or growing crystals block passages over time.</p>
        
        <h4>The Pale Ridges</h4>
        <img src="My documents/Images/Pale Ridges.png" alt="Pale Ridges" style="width:300px; float:right; margin:10px;">
        <p>These mountain formations appear ghostly white from a distance due to their reflective stone structure. They scatter the dim sky-glow in shifting, silver patterns, making the peaks seem as though they fade in and out of existence depending on one's angle.</p>
        <p>Because of the constant half-light, the ridges lack sharp shadows, making their cliffs and ledges treacherously difficult to judge. Winds that pass through narrow stone gaps produce low, haunting tones. Some groups believe these tones are messages from spirits trapped during the Stilling.</p>
        <p>The rock is brittle in some sections and razor-hard in others, often forming natural sigils or crack lines that cultures interpret as omens. The ridges are sparsely vegetated; only hardy Graveblossoms and strands of wellsap roots cling to the stone. The area is avoided by most.</p>
        
        <h4>The Broken Spine</h4>
        <img src="My documents/Images/Broken Spine.png" alt="Broken Spine" style="width:300px; float:right; margin:10px;">
        <p>A jagged chain of ruptured landforms, once a normal mountain range, now fractured during the period following the Stilling. The dark, uplifted stone resembles vertebrae jutting from the earth, giving the region its name. Chasms run between these "bones," some shallow, others descending into unknown depths filled with fog that never dissipates.</p>
        <p>Tremors still shake the Spine on occasion, accompanied by groaning sounds deep underground, as if the earth itself were straining. Travelers must move carefully; Pulse Moss and root networks slowly shift the terrain, widening cracks or covering openings.</p>
        <p>Where the rock split, glowing crystal veins are exposed like nerves. They flicker with faint light, providing natural navigation markers but also attracting fauna that feed on or inhabit the irradiant minerals. The Broken Spine is a borderland, harsh, unstable, and often used as a natural barrier between regions.</p>
        
        <h4>The Breathing Marsh</h4>
        <img src="My documents/Images/The Breathing Marsh.png" alt="Breathing Marsh" style="width:300px; float:right; margin:10px;">
        <p>This wetland is characterized by ground that rises and falls in slow, uneven rhythms, caused by massive, interconnected root systems beneath the mud. The effect is unsettling: fields of marshland that seem to "inhale" and "exhale." Pools of still water shift ever so slightly with each pulse.</p>
        <p>Fog clings permanently to the surface, catching the glow of lichen, fungus, and the occasional creature drifting just above the waterline. The marsh emits soft gurgles and pops as gas escapes from shifting mud pockets, sounds that mimic distant voices or footsteps.</p>
        <p>Travelers must memorize the breathing pattern of any area they cross. A misstep during a downward "breath" can drop a person waist-deep into hungry root systems or sinkholes. Some sections contain Wellsap Vines that drip drinkable moisture, while others release toxic fumes or lure creatures with faint glimmers of light.</p>
        <p>The Breathing Marsh is feared for its unpredictability but valued for its abundance of rare, dangerous plant species and elusive fauna.</p>

        <h2>Technology & Survival</h2>
        
        <p>In Evershade, survival depends on adapting to constant twilight and learning to read a world where light, sound, and chemical signals replace traditional navigation. Technology is scarce, primarily crafted from organic materials, crystals, and creature remains. Trade networks exist but are fragile, as different cultures guard their specialized knowledge jealously.</p>
        
        <h3>Common Tools</h3>
        
        <p>Most tools in Evershade are living, grown, or harvested from the environment rather than manufactured. Metal is rare, most pre-Stilling reserves have corroded or been lost. What remains is carefully hoarded.</p>
        
        <h4>Crystal Lanterns</h4>
        <p><strong>Source:</strong> Harvested from the Crystal Hollows by Deepstone miners</p>
        <p><strong>Function:</strong> Portable light sources that glow steadily without fuel. Different crystal types produce different colored light.</p>
        <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Crystals must be "recharged" periodically by exposing them to bioluminescent environments or burying them in mineral-rich soil.</p>
        <p><strong>Trade Value:</strong> Highly regulated. Over-harvesting causes crystals to "go dark" permanently. Illegal mining is punishable by exile.</p>
        
        <h4>Resin Masks</h4>
        <p><strong>Source:</strong> Grown from rare plants cultivated by the Glass Maskers</p>
        <p><strong>Function:</strong> Filter toxic spores, sweet-smelling traps (like Sweetbreath blooms), and harmful mists. The mask is a living organism that bonds to the wearer's face.</p>
        <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Requires regular exposure to clean moisture and occasional "feeding" with sap from Wellsap Vines. A damaged mask must be regrown, taking weeks.</p>
        <p><strong>Cultural Significance:</strong> Mask-making knowledge is closely guarded. Stealing or damaging someone's mask is considered equivalent to murder in some settlements.</p>
        
        <h4>Vine-Blades</h4>
        <p><strong>Source:</strong> Crafted from hardened plant matter, often from deceased Glassleaf Shrubs or fossilized root systems</p>
        <p><strong>Function:</strong> Lightweight weapons that can cut through flesh and softer materials. Some variants retain mild toxins from their plant origins.</p>
        <p><strong>Crafting:</strong> Blades are shaped through slow heating and pressure, then tempered in mineral-rich mud.</p>
        
        <h4>Bone Tools</h4>
        <p><strong>Source:</strong> Fashioned from remains of Hollow Howlers, Shardback Beasts, and other large fauna</p>
        <p><strong>Function:</strong> Versatile implements used as knives, scrapers, needles, and structural supports</p>
        <p><strong>Cultural Practice:</strong> Many cultures perform ritual thanks before harvesting bones, believing the creature's spirit guides the tool's use.</p>
        
        <h4>Light-Farming Cages</h4>
        <p><strong>Source:</strong> Woven from dried vines and crystal fragments</p>
        <p><strong>Function:</strong> Containers for cultivating small bioluminescent organisms like fungal colonies, glow-insects, or young Bulbskulls (though the latter is taboo in most regions)</p>
        <p><strong>Use:</strong> Provide sustainable light sources for settlements without access to Crystal Hollows.</p>
        
        <hr>
        <h3>Methods of Navigation</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Glow Trails:</strong> Experienced travelers learn to read the patterns of bioluminescent flora. Certain plant combinations indicate water sources, stable ground, or dangerous areas. The Beacon-Tailed migration routes leave faintly glowing trails that persist for years.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Creature Migration Paths:</strong> Following Beacon-Tailed and other migratory species is risky but often reveals the safest routes through treacherous terrain. These creatures instinctively avoid Watcher territories and unstable ground.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Sound Tapping:</strong> A technique borrowed from Whisperbats. Travelers tap walking sticks against stone or wood, listening for echoes that reveal hollow spaces, water, or predators. The Deepstone Cities use advanced sound-mapping to chart underground passages.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Marked Root Systems:</strong> Stable root networks are carved with symbols indicating direction, water sources, shelter locations, and warnings. Different cultures use different symbol systems, leading to occasional misinterpretation.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Crystal Resonance:</strong> In areas near the Crystal Hollows, certain crystals hum or pulse when aligned with underground water or stable pathways. Experienced travelers carry tuning crystals to detect these vibrations.</p>

        <h3>Survival Techniques</h3>
        
        <h4>Light Management</h4>
        <p>Controlling light is essential for survival. Too much attracts predators; too little invites Watchers. Experienced travelers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Carry multiple light sources with varying intensities</li>
            <li>Dim crystal lanterns when passing through dangerous areas</li>
            <li>Use bioluminescent creatures that can suppress their glow on command</li>
            <li>Avoid total darkness, even faint light is better than none</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Reading the Environment</h4>
        <p>The wilderness speaks through subtle signals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sudden silence</strong> - Predators nearby or Watchers present</li>
            <li><strong>Plants dimming</strong> - Danger approaching; many flora react to threats</li>
            <li><strong>Fog thickening rapidly</strong> - Unstable ground or chemical emissions</li>
            <li><strong>Root systems vibrating</strong> - Tremors, large creatures, or underground shifts</li>
            <li><strong>Sweetbreath scent</strong> - Change direction immediately; spores travel far</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Water Sources</h4>
        <p>Finding safe water is critical:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wellsap Vines</strong> - Best source if safe variants are identified</li>
            <li><strong>Condensation collectors</strong> - Cloth or leaves placed to catch moisture from fog</li>
            <li><strong>Crystal pools</strong> - Water near certain crystals often becomes purified over time</li>
            <li><strong>Never drink from standing marsh water</strong> - High toxin concentration</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Shelter Construction</h4>
        <p>Temporary shelters must balance safety with discretion:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Build near stable root systems for structural support</li>
            <li>Use bioluminescent organisms to mark safe zones around camp</li>
            <li>Avoid areas with heavy Graveblossom growth (indicates recent death)</li>
            <li>Never shelter in total darkness or overly bright locations</li>
            <li>Rotate sleeping positions, many predators track breathing patterns</li>
        </ul>
        
        <hr>
        <h3>Common Dangers</h3>
        
        <h4>Environmental Hazards</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spore clouds</strong> - From Sweetbreath Traps, toxic fungi, or disturbed plant matter</li>
            <li><strong>Unstable ground</strong> - Pulse Moss, Breathing Marsh rhythms, root collapse</li>
            <li><strong>Sudden darkness</strong> - Equipment failure, crystal dimming, or Watcher presence</li>
            <li><strong>Toxic mists</strong> - Chemical emissions from decaying matter or plant defense</li>
            <li><strong>Tremors</strong> - Especially near the Broken Spine; can trigger avalanches</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Creature Threats</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Glow-hunters</strong> - Predators that track bioluminescence</li>
            <li><strong>Sound-trackers</strong> - Creatures using echolocation to hunt (avoid loud noises)</li>
            <li><strong>Ambush flora</strong> - Plants like Glassleaf Shrubs that blend into surroundings</li>
            <li><strong>Territorial fauna</strong> - Whisperbats and Beacon-Tailed defend nesting zones</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Human Threats</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Resource raiders</strong> - Groups that attack traders for crystal lanterns or masks</li>
            <li><strong>Cultists</strong> - Aggressive Sunbound factions that view others as obstacles</li>
            <li><strong>Isolationists</strong> - Forest Kin or other groups defending territory</li>
            <li><strong>Desperate travelers</strong> - Those who've lost supplies and turned to violence</li>
        </ul>
