        <h2>THE STILLING</h2>
        <p>Many decades ago, during a global solar eclipse on Earth, the sun stopped moving:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It did not vanish</li>
            <li>It did not explode</li>
            <li>It simply froze in place</li>
            <li>No more sunrise or sunset</li>
            <li>Never again a real day or night</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The world was left in a permanent, dim twilight. The sun still glows faintly in the sky, but it no longer warms the land or feeds plant life the way it once did. The eclipse never passes, creating the impression that time itself is stalled alongside the sun.</p>
        <p><strong>This shift disrupted everything:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Climates collapsed</li>
            <li>Ecosystems fell apart</li>
            <li>Old civilizations toppled because crops couldn't grow and animals migrated in confusion or died off</li>
            <li>What survived did so unevenly, leaving gaps in food chains and destabilizing entire regions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Many surviving cultures now refer to the event simply as <strong>"The Stilling."</strong> It became the dividing line in history: <strong>"Before the Stilling"</strong> and <strong>"After the Stilling"</strong></p>
        <p>Timekeeping became a cultural problem. Different groups invented their own measurements of time based on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Crystal glow cycles</li>
            <li>Bioluminescent plant pulses</li>
            <li>Creature migration patterns</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Over a span of centuries, the planet's name changed to <strong>"Evershade"</strong>.</p>

        <h2>CURRENT WORLD STATE</h2>
        <h3>Light & Atmosphere</h3>
        <p>Evershade's lighting is constant: a soft, cold, blue-grey tone that never changes. It's bright enough to see, but never enough to feel safe.</p>
        <p>Shadows barely exist. Edges blur, distances distort, and the land often feels dreamlike. Travelers often misjudge slopes, distances, or approaching threats due to the lack of contrast.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere itself has changed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Heavy and damp, often pressing on the lungs</li>
            <li>Fog accumulates easily and stays for long periods</li>
            <li>Sound carries unusually far, sometimes echoing strangely</li>
            <li>The world feels slow, as if time itself is moving at half-speed</li>
            <li>Many places feel like they're holding their breath, suspended between movement and stillness</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Travelers often describe the world as: <strong>Quiet, suspended, half-asleep and watching.</strong></p>
        
        <h3>Weather</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Very light snow known as <em>"Ashfrost"</em> - slow, drifting, harmless</li>
            <li>Occasional windstorms that carry spores</li>
            <li>Bioluminescent "rain threads" in Glowforest areas</li>
            <li>No thunder or lightning anymore</li>
            <li>Rare glowing fog banks that confuse senses</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Storms are rare and subdued, lacking violence but creating unease through their silence and unpredictability.</p>
