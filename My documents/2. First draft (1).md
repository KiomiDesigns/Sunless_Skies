## **1\. THE STILLING**

Many decades ago, during a global solar eclipse, the sun stopped moving. It did not vanish. It did not explode. It simply froze in place. From that moment on there was no sunrise or sunset. Never again a real day or night.

The world was left in a permanent, dim twilight. The sun still glows faintly in the sky, but it no longer warms the land or feeds plant life the way it once did.

This moment became the dividing line in history: “Before the Stilling” and “After the Stilling”

Timekeeping became a cultural problem. Different groups invented their own measurements of time based on:

* Crystal glow cycles  
* Bioluminescent plant pulses  
* Creature migration patterns

Over the years the planet their name changed to “Evershade”

## **2\. CURRENT WORLD STATE**

### **Light & Atmosphere**

* Constant dim blue-grey lighting everywhere  
* No clear shadows, only soft gradients  
* Air often feels heavy and wet  
* Fog settles easily and stays for long periods  
* Sound travels farther than before

The world feels:

* Quiet  
* Slow  
* Suspended  
* Half-asleep

## **3\. FLORA SYSTEM**

### **General Rules**

* Almost all surviving plants are:  
  * Bioluminescent  
  * Carnivorous or parasitic  
  * Chemical-based feeders  
* Most plants are active, not passive.  
* The world follows a basic truth:

   *The more beautiful the plant, the more dangerous it is*.

### **Known Flora**

**Sweetbreath Traps**  
 Plants that release hypnotic fragrance. Victims feel calm, peaceful, and euphoric. Roots sense falling vibrations and gently pull unconscious bodies underground.

**Graveblossoms**  
 Flowers that grow from dead wood. They feed on decay and emit soft silver, pale blue, or violet glow.

**Wellsap Vines**  
 Water-producing plants that collect moisture and condense it into drinkable liquid. Some variants are safe. Others contain slow poisons.

**Glassleaf Shrubs**  
 Transparent leaves that cut skin when brushed against. They refract biolight into beautiful patterns to lure prey.

**Pulse Moss**  
 A carpet-like moss that expands and contracts like breathing. It can shift the ground over time and slowly swallow fallen objects.

**Memory Reeds**  
 Tall, thin plants that release faint whispering sounds when touched. Some believe they store echoes of past events.

**Corpse Lanterns**  
 Fungus that grows on buried skeletons and glows stronger the more bone it touches.

## **4\. FAUNA SYSTEM**

### **General Rules**

* Most creatures:  
  * Rely on echolocation  
  * Use scent trails  
  * Produce their own light

* Eyes are often reduced or replaced by:  
  * Heat sensing pits  
  * Sound receptors  
  * Vibrational whiskers

### **Known and Expanded Fauna**

**Bulbskulls**  
 Small survival creatures with oversized storage heads.

**Echo-Wings**  
 Bat-like armored fliers with sonar-based navigation.

**Beacon Tailed Wanderers**  
 Snake or lizard-like creatures that glow along their bodies.

**Drift Hunters**  
 Jellyfish-like floating creatures in the air that pulse dim light and sting prey.

**Shardback Beasts**  
 Thick-skinned animals with crystal growths on their backs that naturally glow.

**Hollow Howlers**  
 Blind quadrupeds that sense air pressure and movement. Their calls disorient prey.

**Rootleeches**  
 Worm-like creatures that live in plant root systems and drink sap or blood.

## **5\. INTELLIGENT FOLK & ENTITIES**

### **Known Groups**

**The Deepstone Cities**  
 Underground crystal-powered civilizations.

* Underground crystal-powered civilizations  
* Use glowing crystal veins for light, transport, and energy  
* Buildings carved from solid rock and reinforced with crystal frameworks  
* Culture based on order, silence, and resource conservation

**The Bloodless Forest Kin (Tree Beings)**

* Branch-and-roots bodies with bark-like skin  
* Do not bleed or require traditional food  
* Ritual-based and symbol-heavy culture  
* Navigate and communicate through carved forest markings

**The Watchers**  
 Shadow creatures that live in the deepest unlit spaces.

* Shadow-dwelling entities  
* Instinctively trigger the feeling of being watched  
* Feed on blood, warmth, and fear  
* Believed by some to exist from before the sun stopped

**The Glass Maskers**

* Humans wearing transparent resin masks grown from plants  
* Masks filter toxic air, spores, and sweet-smelling traps  
* Highly cautious, quiet, and survival-focused culture  
* Dependent on rare plants for mask repair and regrowth

**The Lantern Keepers**

* Nomadic travelers who bond with glowing creatures  
* Use living light instead of artificial tools  
* Treat bioluminescent animals as partners, not property  
* Prioritize movement, sound, and soft light over permanence

**The Sunbound** 

* Cult devoted to reigniting or restoring the sun  
* Collect and hoard bright or reflective artifacts  
* Worship brightness as sacred and pure  
* Perform rituals using mirrors, lenses, crystals, and fire-like glows

### **Known Biomes**

**Glowforests**  
 Forests of luminous trees and fungi.

**Root Seas**  
 Underground regions where massive root systems replace oceans.

**Crystal Hollows**  
 Caverns filled with glowing mineral formations.

**The Soft Cities**
