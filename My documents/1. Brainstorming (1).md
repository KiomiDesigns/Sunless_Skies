### **General Setting**

Decades ago, during what should have been an ordinary solar eclipse, the sun simply… stopped. Suspended in the sky like a dying ember, it no longer rose or set. Its once-blazing light diminished into a weak, permanent glow, just enough to cast the world in a perpetual dimness, but never enough to nourish it.

In the years that followed, ecosystems collapsed. Many plants and animals that relied on the sun died off entirely, leaving behind silent forests, empty plains, and oceans that cooled to inky black. But as the old world withered, something new stirred. The constant darkness awakened strange evolutions, organisms shaping themselves to survive the era of dusk.

Light did not disappear; instead, it shifted hosts. Faint bioluminescence now threads through leaves, eyes, fur, scales, and roots. In the absence of the sun, the world learned to glow.

## **Flora Concepts**

General Themes:

* Beauty signals danger.  
* Bioluminescence is common, colors range from ghostly blues to sickly greens to deep crimson pulses.  
* Most plants evolved to trap, dissolve, or parasitize creatures instead of photosynthesizing.

### **Flora Ideas**

• The Dreamvapor Bloom  
A breathtakingly fragrant plant with sugar-sweet scent trails that drift in an area around it. Its perfume induces euphoria and disorientation. The air around its petals becomes toxic after prolonged exposure. When prey collapses, the plant’s hair-thin roots creep outward, curl around limbs, and slowly drag the body beneath the soil. Underground bulbs dissolve the corpse into nutrients over weeks.

• Corpse-Perch Flowers  
These pale blossoms grow only on the rotting trunks of long-dead trees. Their glow intensifies when they detect decay nearby, drawing scavengers that help spread their spores. Touching the petals causes paralysis for several hours, useful for the plant, lethal for the unwary.

• Wellsap Vines  
Thick, translucent vines that produce cold, drinkable water inside their hollow bodies. They absorb moisture from the air and condense it internally. Many species depend on them but the vines have thorns that inject a numbing toxin. Some tribes carefully cultivate “tamed” vines.

• Glowshard Briars  
 Bushes covered in crystalline, bioluminescent thorns. These thorns break off easily and embed themselves into passing animals; the briar then absorbs nutrients as the creature bleeds or as the thorn dissolves into the bloodstream.

• Lantern Fungus  
 A towering fungi species whose caps emit steady warm light. Entire forests of them exist, creating softly illuminated groves. They feed on buried organic matter and release spores that form drifting clouds of golden dust.

**Fauna ideas:**

- A very small creature that has a big head where they store their water and food.   
- A creature with big ears and echolocation so they can navigate in the darkest places. Wings and hard skin  
- A creature with a body and tail that can light the area around them. basically a build in lamp.

**Folk ideas:**

- A group of people that went underground and use powered crystals to navigate, light up and form their city  
- A creature of darkness, when you feel watched in the dark, it is probably them. They eat anything that has blood.  
- Tree creatures, need the bair minimum to survive. Don’t have blood in them and exist of roots and brances. Use rituals and signs in the forest to guide their way.

## **Fauna Concepts**

**General Themes:**

* Many animals have adapted to low-light environments through hearing, scent, or bioluminescence.  
* Creatures tend to store reserves of water and food internally, since resources are scarce.  
* Predators evolved to hunt using glow patterns, vibrations, or scent trails.

### **Fauna Ideas**

**• Bulbskull Critters**  
Tiny, slow-moving creatures with oversized, translucent heads used as biological storage tanks. They fill these “skulls” with water, fat, and nutrients. When frightened, they can flash the contents with a quick burst of light to stun small predators or alert their colony.

**• Echowing Ravagers**  
Lean, bat-like hunters with enormous ears capable of picking up the softest echoes. Their wings are reinforced with hard, armor-like skin, allowing them to glide silently or scrape against stone to send specific sonar signals. They navigate pitch black caves, abandoned cities, and root tunnels.

**• Beacon Serpents**  
Long, sinewy creatures with a glowing stripe along their spine and tail. Their bioluminescence brightens when they’re hunting or communicating. In darkness, they function like wandering lanterns. Many travelers follow them, though some Beacon Serpents intentionally lure prey with their friendly glow.

**• Hollow Maw Predators**  
Blind, pale quadrupeds with empty-looking faces. Their “mouths” are not for eating but for inhaling scent trails and heat signatures. They swallow prey whole, then let symbiotic microbes digest it internally.

## **People & Folk Concepts**

**General Themes:**

* Humanity fractured into unique survival cultures.  
* Some embraced light through artificial means; others adapted to darkness or fused with the new bioluminescent ecosystem.

### **Folk Ideas**

**• The Deepstone Dwellers**  
A civilization that retreated beneath the earth after the Eclipse. They discovered luminescent crystal deposits and learned to harvest and charge them. Their cities gleam with shifting hues powered by crystal cores. They use carved crystal rods as tools, lanterns, and weapons.

**• The Watchers in the Dark**  
Shadow-dwelling beings, mutated descendants of humans, who thrive in pure absence of light. Their bodies are nearly invisible in darkness, and their presence is sensed only through the prickling feeling of being watched. They drink blood or consume anything warm. Their society is rumored to be based on whispering rituals and silent hierarchy.

**• The Treeborn**  
Humanoid entities grown rather than born. Their bodies consist of bark, woven roots, and jointed branches. They require little nourishment aside from minerals and faint light from fungi. They paint symbols on tree trunks and carve runes in the forest floor, forming a map-like language for communication and spiritual rites.
