## 

## **1\. THE STILLING** {#1.-the-stilling}

Many decades ago, during a global solar eclipse on Earth, the sun stopped moving. It did not vanish. It did not explode. It simply froze in place. From that moment on there was no sunrise or sunset. Never again a real day or night.

The world was left in a permanent, dim twilight. The sun still glows faintly in the sky, but it no longer warms the land or feeds plant life the way it once did. The eclipse never passes, creating the impression that time itself is stalled alongside the sun.

This shift disrupted everything: climates collapsed, ecosystems fell apart, and old civilizations toppled because crops couldn’t grow and animals migrated in confusion or died off. What survived did so unevenly, leaving gaps in food chains and destabilizing entire regions.

Many surviving cultures now refer to the event simply as **“**The Stilling**.”** It became the dividing line between the old world and the new one:

This moment became the dividing line in history: “Before the Stilling” and “After the Stilling”

Timekeeping became a cultural problem. Different groups invented their own measurements of time based on:

* Crystal glow cycles  
* Bioluminescent plant pulses  
* Creature migration patterns

Over a span of centuries the planet’s name changed to “Evershade”.

## 

## **2\. CURRENT WORLD STATE** {#2.-current-world-state}

### **Light & Atmosphere** {#light-&-atmosphere}

Evershade’s lighting is constant: a soft, cold, blue-grey tone that never changes. It’s bright enough to see, but never enough to feel safe.

Shadows barely exist. Edges blur, distances distort, and the land often feels dreamlike. Travelers often misjudge slopes, distances, or approaching threats due to the lack of contrast.

The atmosphere itself has changed:

* Heavy and damp, often pressing on the lungs  
* Fog accumulates easily and stays for long periods  
* Sound carries unusually far, sometimes echoing strangely  
* The world feels slow, as if time itself is moving at half-speed  
* Many places feel like they’re holding their breath, suspended between movement and stillness

Travelers often describe the world as: Quiet, suspended, half-asleep and watching.

### **Weather** {#weather}

* Very light snow known as *“*Ashfrost*”*  slow, drifting, harmless  
* Occasional windstorms that carry spores  
* Bioluminescent “rain threads” in Glowforest areas  
* No thunder or lightning anymore  
* Rare glowing fog banks that confuse senses

Storms are rare and subdued, lacking violence but creating unease through their silence and unpredictability.

## 

## **3\. FLORA SYSTEM** {#3.-flora-system}

### **General Rules** {#general-rules}

Most plants that survived or evolved afterward share certain traits:

* Bioluminescent  
  * Carnivorous or parasitic  
  * Chemical-based feeders  
  * Many are reactive or even borderline “aware” of their environment  
  * Most plants are active, not passive. They respond to vibration, warmth, and chemical signals rather than relying on sunlight alone.

Plants evolved larger leaves and expanded surface areas to capture even the smallest remnants of solar energy. In many cases, light serves more as a signaling mechanism than a food source. 

The world follows a basic truth:

 *The more beautiful the plant, the more dangerous it is*.

Not all flora is hostile, but most require caution.

### **Known Flora** {#known-flora}

#### **Sweetbreath Traps (expanding)** {#sweetbreath-traps-(expanding)}

1\. Basic Identity

* **Name**: 

Sweetbreath Trap, *Ambrosivora soporis*

* **Appearance**: 

The Sweetbreath Trap takes the form of a tall, elegant flower rising from a slender, dark stem. Its petals are layered and curved upward like a blooming flame or lotus, colored in deep violet, indigo, and soft magenta hues. The inner petals glow more intensely, fading outward into darker purples at the edges.

Tiny spore-like motes drift constantly around the flower, suspended in the air like fireflies or ash. These particles pulse faintly with light and slowly spiral downward before evaporating. The spores are densest near the bloom and thin out several meters away, creating a visible “aura” around the plant.

The plant’s leaves are broad, waxy, and shadow-dark, blending into the forest floor, making the luminous flower appear almost floating.

1 meter tall when fully grown

* **Growth pattern**:

Perennial. Grows solitary or in loose clusters where air circulation is minimal, allowing spores to linger.

2\. Environmental Context

* **Biomes**:   
  * Glowforest Expanse (deep interior zones)  
  * Sheltered clearings near marsh edges  
* **Light conditions**: 

Permanent twilight. The plant’s glow is strongest in near-darkness and dims slightly if exposed to brighter artificial light.

* **Soil/medium**: 

Soft, damp forest soil rich in fungal networks and decay. Often rooted near fallen trees or old burial sites.

* **Climate**: 

Cool, humid, and fog-prone. Still air enhances the effectiveness of its spores.

3\. Biological Function

* **Energy strategy**:

Primarily carnivorous with chemical supplementation.

* The plant produces bioluminescent spores that double as sedative delivery systems.  
* Once prey collapses nearby, root tendrils slowly emerge from beneath the soil to envelop and absorb nutrients.

Limited photosynthesis occurs through the glowing petals, but this only sustains basic metabolic functions

* **Life cycle**:   
  * Spores settle into nutrient-rich soil and remain dormant until detecting organic decay.  
  * Juvenile plants emit faint purple light but no spores.  
    Mature plants release continuous spore clouds.  
  * Reproduction occurs after a successful feeding; excess nutrients trigger a spore “bloom surge.”  
  *   
* **Symbiosis**: 

Often found growing among fungi and pulse moss, which help circulate spores through subtle ground movement.

* **Defense mechanisms**:   
  * Sedative spores induce calm, slowed breathing, and emotional warmth  
  * Mild neurotoxins suppress panic responses  
  * Root systems retract quickly if disturbed violently

4\. Interaction with Fauna

* Is it **food or hazard**?

Ambush predator.

* **Attracts/repels** animals?

Attracts. The glowing purple petals and drifting spores visually resemble harmless bioluminescent plants, especially in low visibility. Has a very sweet and alluring smell that pulls creatures towards it.

* **Defense v. offense**:  
  * Smaller creatures succumb quickly

  * Larger animals may linger, disoriented, before collapsing  
  * Some predators use Sweetbreath Traps as hunting grounds, waiting for weakened prey  
* **Coevolution**: 

Certain species have evolved:

* Spore-filtering nasal membranes  
  * Aversion to violet light clusters  
  * Ultrasonic warning calls when spores are detected

5\. Sensory Qualities

* **Smell, sound, “feel”** 

**Smell:**  
Sweet, floral, and soothing, often described as nostalgic or “safe.”  
**Visual Effect:**  
A constant slow drift of glowing purple motes, like pollen caught in still air.  
**Touch:**  
Petals are warm and faintly vibrating. Spores feel like dust but leave a tingling sensation on skin.

* **Bioluminescence**: 

Color: Violet core fading to soft pink  
Rhythm: Slow pulsing, synchronized with spore release

* **Effects on senses**: 

Emotional comfort, drowsiness, reduced fear and pain perception, mild dreamlike hallucinations, passing out.

6\. Cultural Meaning

* **Mythology or folklore**: 

Known as *“The Dreamer’s Bloom”* or *“The Violet Mercy.”*  
Some cultures believe the spores carry fragments of memories from past victims.

* **Human use**:   
- Carefully harvested spores used in sleep-inducing tonics  
- Ritual burnings of dried petals to calm grief-stricken communities  
- Highly dangerous if inhaled in enclosed spaces  
* **Economic role**: 

Rare and regulated. Trade is controlled by Deepstone alchemists and forbidden in most surface settlements.

7\. Narrative Role & Symbolism

The Sweetbreath Trap represents false peace, seductive beauty, and the danger of surrender in Evershade.

Visually, it stands out as one of the most beautiful plants in the world, glowing gently, almost hopeful, which reinforces the core rule of the ecosystem:

*The more beautiful the plant, the more dangerous it is.*

#### **Wellsap Vines (expanding)** {#wellsap-vines-(expanding)}

1\. Basic Identity

* **Name**: Wellsap Vines, *Hydrosiphon lumiligna*  
* **Appearance**: 

Wellsap Vines appear as long, winding strands that cling to trees, stone, ruins, and cave walls like slow-moving veins. Their main body is a semi-translucent, pale blue to milky white, with faint hints of green and silver running through it. These inner veins glow softly, pulsing at irregular intervals as moisture moves through the plant.

Along the length of the vine grow bulb-like nodes, about the size of a clenched fist. These nodes are slightly swollen, smooth, and glassy in texture, as if stretched thin from within. When full, they glow brighter and become almost transparent, revealing liquid slowly condensing inside. Over time, droplets form and fall from small pores at the node’s base.

The vine’s surface feels cool and rubbery, but becomes firmer when cut or stressed. Fine, hair-thin tendrils branch off from the main vine, anchoring it into cracks, bark, or soil. These tendrils often disappear into moss, root systems, or porous stone, making it hard to tell where the plant truly begins or ends.

In still air, Wellsap Vines emit a faint shimmering haze, caused by microscopic moisture particles reflecting their glow. When many vines grow together, the area takes on the appearance of a softly lit, dripping lattice suspended in darkness.

Visually, Wellsap Vines feel quiet, patient, and restrained, less aggressive than other Evershade flora, but never fully safe.

* **Growth pattern**: 

Perennial; slow-growing but expansive once established. Often found in tangled clusters clinging to stone, trees, or ruins.

2\. Environmental Context

* **Biomes**:   
- Glowforest Expanse  
- The Breathing Marsh  
- Cave entrances near the Crystal Hollows  
* **Light conditions**: 

Thrives in permanent dim light. Excessive brightness causes the vines to retract and stop producing liquid.

* **Soil/medium**: 

Anchors into damp soil, rotting wood, or porous stone. Root structures spread wide rather than deep, tapping into ambient moisture.

* **Climate**: 

Prefers humid, fog-heavy environments with slow air movement.

3\. Biological Function

* **Energy strategy**:

Wellsap Vines use a mixed survival system:

- Minimal photosynthesis through faintly glowing leaves  
- Chemical absorption of minerals and moisture from surrounding material

**Water Production:**  
 The vine condenses airborne moisture along translucent veins, slowly channeling it into bulb-like nodes. These nodes swell over time until they drip clear liquid.

* **Life cycle**:   
- Germinates from spores released during periods of high humidity  
- Young vines attach quickly to nearby surfaces  
- Mature vines begin producing wellsap nodes after several growth cycles  
* **Symbiosis**: 

Many plants use it as a source of hydration.

* **Defense mechanisms**:   
- Vines tighten or harden if cut improperly  
- Some variants produce mildly toxic sap that accumulates over repeated consumption

4\. Interaction with Fauna

* Is it **food or hazard**? 

Both. 

-  Smaller creatures pierce the nodes carefully to drink without poisoning themselves  
- Larger animals may tear the vines free, often killing the plant  
- Certain Rootleeches nest inside older vine clusters  
* **Attracts/repels**

Attracts, its one of the best and most used sources of hydration.

* **Defense v. offense**: 

Defense, it survives by growing big and long.

* **Coevolution**:

Over time, fauna in Wellsap-heavy regions have developed resistance to low-level toxins.

5\. Sensory Qualities

* **Smell, sound, “feel”**   
- Faint dripping or creaking as nodes fill and release liquid  
- Clean and mineral-like, sometimes misleadingly fresh  
* **Bioluminescence**: 

**Color:** Pale blue to blue-green, with a milky, translucent quality.  
**Rhythm:** Slow, uneven pulses that follow internal moisture flow rather than a steady pattern.  
**Intensity:** Low to moderate. Bright enough to mark safe drinking spots but not strong enough to illuminate surroundings fully.

* **Effects on senses**:   
- Drinking small amounts causes a cooling sensation in the mouth and throat.  
- Repeated consumption of unsafe variants may cause mild dizziness, numbness in extremities, or delayed reactions.  
- Prolonged exposure to dense vine clusters can slightly dull smell perception, making it harder to detect nearby threats.

6\. Cultural Meaning

* **Mythology or folklore**:

Wellsap Vines are commonly known as *“the patient gift”* in many cultures. Myths describe them as remnants of the world’s mercy after the Stilling, plants that learned to “hold water” when the skies no longer provided it. Some stories claim the vines were once ordinary roots that adapted out of sympathy for dying creatures.

Among Deepstone City dwellers, Wellsap Vines are believed to listen. It is considered disrespectful to speak loudly or argue near a vine cluster, as this is thought to “spoil” the sap. In marsh cultures, unsafe variants are seen as cursed, deliberately placed by the land to punish greed.

* **Human use**: 

**Medicine:** Purified Wellsap is used to cool fevers, treat dehydration, and stabilize crystal sickness caused by prolonged exposure to bioluminescent minerals.  
**Poisoning:** Toxic variants are carefully extracted and diluted to create slow-acting sedatives or paralysis agents.  
**Art & Decoration:** Dried vine casings are sometimes woven into talismans or drinking vessels believed to ward off thirst or bad travel luck.

* **Economic role**: 

Wellsap Vines are a semi-controlled resource. Safe variants are traded between settlements, often marked with braided fiber bands to indicate testing and purification. Entire regions restrict harvesting, as overuse causes the vines to wither permanently. In some cultures, selling untested sap is a severe taboo, punishable by exile.

7\. Narrative Role & Symbolism

* Legends claim the earliest Wellsap Vines appeared shortly after the Stilling, growing where rivers dried and lakes receded. Their presence often marks old water routes, forgotten settlements, or migration paths lost to time.  
* Travelers’ tales often describe moments of salvation where a single vine cluster saved entire groups from dehydration. Conversely, tragic stories warn of false hope, where poisoned sap led explorers to slow deaths after days of thirst.  
* In narrative terms, Wellsap Vines act as a moral test. Finding one suggests survival is possible, but never guaranteed. They foreshadow relief tempered by caution, reinforcing the world’s core rule: beauty and usefulness in Evershade are never without risk.

#### 

#### Graveblossoms (expanding) {#graveblossoms-(expanding)}

1\. Basic Identity

* **Name**: 

Graveblossoms, *Mortifloris lucens*

* **Appearance**: 

Graveblossoms are bioluminescent flowering growths that emerge directly from dead or rotting wood rather than soil. They sprout from cracked bark, hollow trunks, exposed roots, and fallen branches, appearing as vivid wounds of light against lifeless timber.

Each blossom resembles a layered, spiral-shaped flower with thick, petal-like growths that curl inward toward a glowing core. The petals are semi-translucent and fibrous, with textures somewhere between wax, fungus, and dried flesh. Their coloration ranges from deep crimson and blood-red to hot pink and soft rose, intensifying toward the center where the glow is strongest.

The light they emit is warm but unsettling, a steady internal radiance rather than a flicker. At night, or in Evershade’s constant twilight, the blossoms appear almost ember-like, as if the dead wood itself is smoldering from within. When clustered together, they create the illusion that entire trees are burning slowly without heat or flame.

Graveblossoms often shed faint glowing motes, spore-like particles that drift lazily through the air before fading. These motes settle into cracks in nearby wood, where new growths may later emerge.

The surrounding bark is usually darkened, twisted, or split open, as though the plant has forced its way outward from inside the tree. Over time, heavy infestation causes the wood to become brittle and hollow, riddled with glowing scars.

Visually, Graveblossoms are striking and beautiful, but unmistakably tied to death and decay. They do not grow where life is healthy, only where something has already ended.

* **Growth pattern**: 

Perennial. Slow-growing but persistent. Graveblossoms spread gradually through spore release and internal root-like filaments that travel through dead wood. They often appear in clusters, forming glowing trails across fallen forests or old grave sites.

2\. Environmental Context

* **Biomes**:  
- Glowforest Expanse (areas of fallen growth)  
- The Pale Ridges (rotting scaffolds, old shelters)  
- Marsh edges and drowned forests  
- Ruins, grave sites, and abandoned settlements  
* **Light conditions**:

Thrive in permanent dim light. Strong illumination causes the blossoms to dim and close slightly, slowing growth.

* **Soil/medium**: 

Dead wood only. Cannot root in soil or stone. Requires active decay and fungal presence.

* **Climate**: 

Cool, damp environments with little air movement. Fog-heavy regions accelerate blooming.

3\. Biological Function

* **Energy strategy**:

Graveblossoms are saprotrophic, feeding on decay rather than light. They break down dead organic matter using chemical processes and fungal partnerships.

* **Life cycle**:   
- Spores are released when wood reaches advanced decay  
- Spores settle into cracks in dead material  
- Filament-like roots spread internally through the wood  
- Blossoms emerge only once decay is well established  
- Flowers persist until the host material is fully consumed, then wither and darken  
* **Symbiosis**: 

Often grows alongside fungi and pulse moss. Fungal networks help transport nutrients, while Graveblossoms regulate moisture and decay speed.

* **Defense mechanisms**: 

Mild neurotoxic compounds in petals discourage consumption. Light dims when disturbed, camouflaging the plant.

4\. Interaction with Fauna

* Is it **food or hazard**?

Primarily a hazard. Most fauna avoid consuming Graveblossoms directly.

* **Attracts/repels** animals?  
- Attracts insects, scavengers, and spore-feeding creatures  
- Repels large herbivores due to bitterness and toxicity  
* **Defense v. offense**: Is it predator-like?

Purely defensive. Graveblossoms do not trap or hunt.

* **Coevolution**: Do animals have adaptations because of this plant?

Some insects have adapted to feed exclusively on Graveblossom spores, gaining faint bioluminescence themselves.

5\. Sensory Qualities

* **Smell, sound, “feel”**   
- Smell: Damp wood, cold air, faint metallic sweetness  
- Sound: Almost silent, though clusters sometimes emit soft crackling as wood collapses  
- Touch: Petals are dry, papery, and fragile; stems feel fibrous and brittle  
* **Bioluminescence**: 

**Color:**  
Deep red to soft rose, brightest at the center of each blossom and darker along the outer petals. Clusters can tint nearby bark and fog with a faint crimson glow.  
**Rhythm:**  
Slow, irregular brightening and dimming over long intervals. Individual blossoms do not synchronize, creating an uneven, unsettling light.  
**Intensity:**  
Low per flower, enough to mark dead wood clearly. Dense clusters can softly illuminate entire tree trunks or forest floors without casting sharp shadows.

* **Effects on senses**: 

Prolonged exposure can cause melancholy, slowed perception, and a heightened awareness of silence. Some report vivid memories surfacing near large clusters.

6\. Cultural Meaning

* **Mythology or folklore**: 

Graveblossoms are widely known as *“death’s memory flowers.”* Many cultures believe they mark places where something important ended, not just lives, but eras, families, or hopes. Some myths claim the flowers bloom brighter where deaths were unjust or forgotten.

Among the Deepstone Cities, Graveblossoms are believed to store echoes of the dead within their glow. In forest cultures, they are considered neutral, not cursed, but never sacred.

* **Human use**: 

**Medicine:** Extremely diluted extracts are used as sedatives or to ease end-of-life pain  
**Ritual:** Blossoms are placed at memorial sites or burned during mourning ceremonies  
**Art:** Pressed petals are used in inks or dyes that faintly glow in darkness

* **Economic role**: 

Limited and regulated. Harvesting is allowed only from abandoned sites. Taking Graveblossoms from active burial grounds is a serious taboo.

7\. Narrative Role & Symbolism  
Graveblossoms serve as environmental storytellers. Their presence hints at past catastrophe, forgotten settlements, or silent tragedies. They often mark places where the world “gave up” after the Stilling.

In legends, finding Graveblossoms is a warning: something ended here, and not cleanly. Yet they also symbolize quiet persistence, life continuing through decay rather than despite it. Narratively, they foreshadow loss, history, and reflection rather than immediate danger. Where Graveblossoms bloom, the past is close, watching, and unwilling to fully fade.

**Other ideas:**

**Glassleaf Shrubs (lose ideas)**  
Transparent leaves that cut skin when brushed against. They refract biolight into beautiful patterns to lure prey.

**Pulse Moss (lose ideas)**  
A carpet-like moss that expands and contracts like breathing. It can shift the ground over time and slowly swallow fallen objects.

**Memory Reeds (lose ideas)**  
Tall, thin plants that release faint whispering sounds when touched. Some believe they store echoes of past events.

**Corpse Lanterns (lose ideas)**  
Fungus that grows on buried skeletons and glows stronger the more bone it touches.

## **4\. FAUNA SYSTEM** {#4.-fauna-system}

### **General Rules** {#general-rules-1}

Animal life adapted aggressively to the perpetual dimness. Most cannot rely on sight anymore. They evolved:

* Echolocation  
* Complex scent reading  
* Vibrational sensing  
* Bioluminescent communication

Many species use light to signal others or to lure prey.

Eyes are often vestigial, replaced by:

* Heat pits  
* Sound chambers  
* Whisker-like sensors  
* Hardened echolocation plates


### **Known Fauna** {#known-fauna}

#### **Bulbskulls (expanding)** {#bulbskulls-(expanding)}

* **Life cycle**:   
- Born soft-shelled with opaque skulls  
- Skull gradually clears and hardens with age  
- Lifespan: 12–18 years  
* **Reproduction**:

Sexual reproduction with small live births. Offspring cling to adults until their skulls partially form.

4\. Sensory & Perception Systems

* Primary senses:  
- Light sensitivity (low-spectrum)  
- Vibration sensing through limbs  
- Chemical sensing via moist skin  
* Adaptation to low light:

Eyes detect motion and glow rather than shape. Skull filaments subtly brighten or dim for communication.

* Communication:   
- Soft clicking sounds  
- Slow pulsing of internal glow  
- Subtle posture shifts

5\. Defense & Survival Mechanisms

* Defensive traits:   
- Freeze response mimicking inert flora  
- Glow suppression to avoid detection  
- Mild numbing secretion if handled  
* Offensive traits: 

None; Bulbskulls are non-aggressive.

* Predators: 

Marsh stalkers, root-burrowers, glow-hunting avians

* Threat response:

Freeze → hide → flee (never fight)

6\. Interaction with Flora

* Dietary dependence: 

Strong reliance on fungi, Graveblossoms, and Wellsap Vine byproducts.

* Symbiosis:

Prey species and keystone recycler

* Competition: 

Competes lightly with small scavengers and spore-feeders.

* Coevolution:

Some predators evolved glow-filtering vision specifically to hunt Bulbskul

8\. Sensory Presence (From a human perspective)

* Sound: 

Faint liquid shifting and soft clicking, almost like cooling crystal.

* Smell:

Neutral to slightly sweet, with a damp, mineral undertone.

* Visual cues:

Warm amber glow, slow breathing-like pulses, gentle light refraction.

* Tactile impression: 

Cool, soft, slightly slick, with a fragile, glass-like skull surface.

9\. Cultural Meaning

* Mythology & folklore: 

Bulbskulls are believed to store “leftover light” from before the Stilling. Some cultures claim harming one causes light to permanently fade from the area.

* Human interaction: 

Avoided, observed, occasionally protected. Killing one is taboo in many settlements.

* Symbolism: 

Fragile survival, stored hope, quiet endurance.

10\. Narrative Role & Symbolism

* Story function:

Environmental indicator and emotional anchor.

* Association with events: 

Often found near ancient ruins, forgotten paths, or places where life narrowly endured the Stilling.

* Foreshadowing:

Their presence signals a stable but delicate ecosystem, safety that can be lost if disturbed.

#### 

#### **Whisperbats (expanding)** {#whisperbats-(expanding)}

1\. Basic Identity

* **Name**: Whisperbats, *Noctivox membranis*  
* **Species type**: 

Mammal-like, chiropteran (bat-derived)

* **Appearance**: 

Whisperbats are small to medium-sized creatures, roughly the size of a large cat. Their bodies are compact and muscular, covered in dense, charcoal-black fur with a slightly bristled texture. Their skin appears leathery beneath the fur, especially along joints and wing membranes.

Their most striking feature is their oversized ears, tall, veined, and translucent amber-brown, constantly twitching and subtly rotating to track sound. Their wings are leathery and dark, folded tightly against their sides when perched, blending almost seamlessly into their silhouette.

Their eyes are large and almond-shaped, glowing a muted yellow-green in low light. Claws are long, curved, and adapted for gripping bark, stone, or bone-like surfaces.

* **Distinct features**:   
- Oversized sound-focusing ears  
- Wing membranes etched with vein-like ridges  
- Fine facial whiskers for vibration sensing

2\. Environmental Context

* **Biomes:**   
- Glowforest Expanse  
- Ruined woodlands  
- Cave mouths and collapsed structures  
- Graveblossom groves  
* **Range**: 

Localized but wide-ranging within territories. Highly territorial around nesting sites.

* **Climate tolerance**: 

Thrives in cold, damp, and fog-heavy environments. Highly sensitive to sudden heat or dry air.

* **Shelter**: 

Hollow trees, cliff crevices, ruined arches, and fungal-overgrown caverns.

3\. Biological Function

* **Energy source**:

Carnivorous insectivore / small-fauna hunter

Feeds on:

- Spore-feeders  
- Small scavenger creatures  
- Insect-like glow fauna  
* **Metabolism**: 

Fast bursts of activity followed by long resting periods.

* **Life cycle**:   
- Live birth  
- Juveniles cling to parents’ backs for several weeks  
- Lifespan: 10–14 years  
* **Reproduction**: 

Sexual reproduction, low birth rate (usually one offspring at a time)

4\. Sensory & Perception Systems

* Primary senses:  
  * Echolocation  
  * Vibration sensing through wing membranes  
  * Low-light vision  
* Adaptation to low light:  
  * Vision is secondary; sound defines space. Their echolocation clicks are extremely quiet, often inaudible to humans.  
* Communication:   
- Subsonic chirps  
- Wing membrane vibrations  
- Ear posture and tail flicks

5\. Defense & Survival Mechanisms

* Defensive traits:   
- Camouflage through stillness  
- Sound-dampening fur  
- Sudden silence (halts echolocation entirely when threatened)  
* Offensive traits: Venom, crushing jaws, light-luring, sonic attacks  
- Precision strikes using claws  
- Disorienting echo-bursts in enclosed spaces  
* Predators: What hunts it?

Larger marsh hunters, crystal-backed avians

* Threat response: 

Freeze → confuse with sound → retreat vertically

6\. Interaction with Flora

* Dietary dependence: 

Indirect; relies on fauna supported by fungal and bioluminescent ecosystems.

* Symbiosis: 

Often roosts near Graveblossoms. Their droppings enrich deadwood, encouraging blossom growth.

* Environmental impact: 

Controls overpopulation of spore-feeding insects.

7\. Interaction with Other Fauna

* Role in ecosystem: 

Mid-level predator

* Competition: 

Competes with other nocturnal hunters and cave-dwellers.

* Coevolution: 

Some prey species evolved sound-diffusing body structures to evade Whisperbat detection.

8\. Sensory Presence (From a human perspective)

* Sound: 

Almost none. Occasionally a faint clicking or a pressure-like hum in enclosed spaces.

* Smell: 

Dry leather and damp bark.

* Visual cues:

Still silhouettes, sudden wing unfurling, reflective eyes in darkness.

* Tactile impression: 

Warm fur, taut wing membrane, sharp hooked claws.

9\. Cultural Meaning

* Mythology & folklore: 

Seen as watchers of forgotten places. Some believe Whisperbats remember sounds from before the Stilling and replay them in ruins.

* Human interaction: 

Avoided rather than hunted. Killing one is believed to “wake the forest.”

* Symbolism:

Memory, silence, unseen witnesses.

10\. Narrative Role & Symbolism

* Story function: 

Atmospheric tension creature and environmental signal.

* Association with events: Linked to the Stilling, ancient ruins, lost civilizations

Often found near abandoned settlements or places where sound once mattered, markets, temples, halls.

* Foreshadowing:

Their presence suggests the land is listening. Silence becomes dangerous.

#### 

#### **Beacon Tailed (expanding)** {#beacon-tailed-(expanding)}

1\. Basic Identity

* **Name**: Beacon-Tailed, *Luminocauda errans*  
* **Species type**: 

Reptilian–mammalian hybrid (serpentine body with mammalian traits)

* **Appearance**:

Beacon-Tailed are long, low-bodied creatures ranging from 1.5 to 3 meters in length. Their bodies resemble a fusion of lizard and eel: muscular, flexible, and close to the ground. Skin texture varies between smooth, rubbery scales along the belly and slightly ridged, matte plates along the spine.

Their coloration is muted to avoid detection, ashen grey, moss-green, or deep charcoal, but this dull palette sharply contrasts with their most defining feature: a segmented, bioluminescent tail that glows vividly in bands of cyan, pale green, or soft gold.

The head is wedge-shaped with a blunt snout, small nostrils, and narrow slit-like eyes adapted to low light. Limbs are short but powerful, ending in clawed feet used for traction rather than speed.

* **Distinct features**:   
- Bioluminescent, segmented tail used for signaling  
- Semi-translucent tail plates that brighten or dim independently  
- Thick neck muscles allowing sudden defensive turns

2\. Environmental Context

* **Biomes:**   
- Glowforest Expanse  
- The Breathing Marsh  
- The Broken Spine (lower ridges and chasm edges)  
* **Range**: 

Nomadic. Wanderers follow long, repeating migration routes that may take years to complete.

* **Climate tolerance**: 

Highly adaptable; resistant to damp, cold, and spore-heavy air. Sensitive to extreme dryness.

* **Shelter**: 

Temporary dens beneath roots, inside fallen logs, or shallow burrows lined with shed scales.

3\. Biological Function

* **Energy source**:  
  * Omnivorous scavenger

Feeds on:

- Bioluminescent mosses and fungi  
- Small fauna and carrion  
- Mineral-rich soil and crystal flakes  
* **Metabolism**: 

Slow and efficient. Can survive long periods without food by entering a low-activity state.

* **Life cycle**:   
- Eggs laid in warm, sheltered root pockets  
- Hatchlings remain near nest zones for several cycles  
- Lifespan: 20–30 years  
* **Reproduction**: 

Eggs; low clutch size but high hatchling survival.

4\. Sensory & Perception Systems

* Primary senses:  
  * Vibration sensing through belly scales  
  * Chemical sensing (tongue-based)  
  * Low-light vision  
* Adaptation to low light:  
  * Vision is minimal; the tail acts as both communication and environmental feedback.  
* Communication:   
- Tail-light pulses (patterned flashes)  
- Ground vibrations through body movement  
- Low-frequency hisses

5\. Defense & Survival Mechanisms

* Defensive traits:   
- Tail-light shutoff to disappear instantly  
- Sudden blinding flare when threatened  
- Thick hide resistant to minor bites  
* Offensive traits:   
- Powerful constricting coils  
- Crushing bite (non-venomous)  
* Predators: 

Large marsh hunters, Hollow Howlers, crystal-backed beasts

* Threat response: 

Confuse → blind → flee through terrain too tight for pursuers

6\. Interaction with Flora

* Dietary dependence: 

Feeds heavily on Pulse Moss, Glowfungus, and Wellsap residue.

* Symbiosis: 

Their migration paths help spread spores and bioluminescent seeds through scale shedding and waste.

* Environmental impact: 

Over time, their routes become faintly glowing trails, shaping natural pathways used by other fauna and sometimes humans.

7\. Interaction with Other Fauna

* Role in ecosystem: 

Keystone migratory species

* Competition: 

Competes with other scavengers for carrion and glow plants.

* Coevolution: 

Some predators evolved light-filtering eyes to counter tail flares

8\. Sensory Presence (from a human perspective)

* Sound: 

Low scraping of scales, faint tail crackles, deep hissing exhales.

* Smell: 

Earthy, mineral-rich, faintly metallic.

* Visual cues:

Slow-moving bands of light drifting through fog or forest undergrowth.

* Tactile impression: 

Cool, heavy body; smooth belly scales; tail plates warm to the touch.

9\. Cultural Meaning

* Mythology & folklore: 

Often believed to be guides left behind by the world itself. Some cultures say they remember safe paths from before the Stilling.

* Human interaction: 

Not hunted. Following one is considered risky but sometimes lifesaving.

* Symbolism: 

Journey, endurance, fragile guidance.

10\. Narrative Role & Symbolism

* Story function: 

Environmental guide and moral choice.

* Association with events: 

Often appear near shifting terrain, unstable regions, or hidden passages.

* Foreshadowing: 

A glowing trail may signal safety or lead travelers deeper into danger, depending on whether they trust light blindly.

**Other ideas:**

**Drift Hunters**  
Jellyfish-like floating creatures in the air that pulse dim light and sting prey.

**Shardback Beasts**  
Thick-skinned animals with crystal growths on their backs that naturally glow.

**Hollow Howlers**  
Blind quadrupeds that sense air pressure and movement. Their calls disorient prey.

**Rootleeches**  
Worm-like creatures that live in plant root systems and drink sap or blood.

## **5\. INTELLIGENT FOLK & ENTITIES** {#5.-intelligent-folk-&-entities}

### **General Rules** {#general-rules-2}

Most of civilization disappeared. The small groups that were left split up and found out their own ways of surviving this world.

### **Known Groups** {#known-groups}

#### **The Deepstone Cities (expanding)** {#the-deepstone-cities-(expanding)}

1\. Core Identity

* What is the name of the tribe, and what do outsiders call them?

The Deepstone Cities

* Do they have a self-name, and what does it mean?

Self-Name: *Kethra-Dûm* (“Those Who Endure Below”)

* Are they human, post-human, altered, or non-human?

Primarily human-descended, with minor physiological adaptations due to long-term subterranean living.

* Rough population size?

Fragmented city-states; populations range from a few thousand to tens of thousands depending on depth and crystal availability.

* Are they settled, nomadic, or semi-nomadic?

Permanently settled, vertically stratified cities carved into stone and crystal veins.

2\. Origin & History

* The Deepstone peoples trace their survival to the immediate aftermath of the Stilling, when surface crops failed and predators adapted faster than humans.  
* Their origin myth claims the stone itself “opened” to them during the first years of collapse.  
* Early Deepstone settlers followed glowing crystal seams underground, believing them to be the last echoes of the sun’s warmth.  
* Their historical calendar begins at First Descent, the moment the first city sealed itself from the surface.

3\. Environment & Territory  
**Primary Biomes:**  
 Crystal Hollows, deep caverns beneath the Pale Ridges and Broken Spine.  
**Territory Structure:**  
Cities are layered vertically:

* Upper levels: storage, trade halls, visitor zones  
* Mid-levels: habitation, governance  
* Deep levels: sacred crystal chambers and energy cores  
  **Environmental Threats:**  
   Crystal collapse, seismic tremors, oxygen scarcity, crystal “darkening.”

4\. Physical Adaptation & Appearance

* Skin tones trend pale or stone-grey due to lack of surface light.  
* Eyes are sensitive to even faint glow; many citizens wear light-dulling lenses.  
* Clothing is tightly fitted, layered, and muted in color to avoid visual noise.  
* Jewelry and adornments are minimal, often crystal-threaded rather than metallic.

5\. Social Structure

* Highly hierarchical and merit-based.  
* Governance is handled by Crystal Councils, whose members are chosen based on precision, emotional control, and long-term planning ability.  
* Children are raised communally, trained early in silence discipline and spatial awareness.  
* Elders are revered as living archives rather than leaders.


6\. Belief System & Worldview

* The Deepstone belief system views the sun as irrelevant rather than sacred.  
* They believe the surface world is unstable and inherently wasteful.  
* Stone and crystal are considered eternal witnesses to history.  
* Stability is considered the highest moral good.

7\. Rituals & Traditions

* Daily periods of enforced silence known as Still Hours.  
* Initiation rituals involve descending to a deeper level of the city.  
* Death rites consist of sealing the body within crystal-lined stone niches.  
* Loud or chaotic behavior during rituals is considered deeply disrespectful.

8\. Technology & Survival Practices

* Crystal-based energy systems power lighting, heating, and signaling.  
* Sound-dampening architecture prevents echoes and vibrations.  
* Tools are designed for efficiency and longevity rather than speed.  
* Artificial bioluminescence is strictly regulated to prevent energy waste.

9\. Relationship with Flora & Fauna

* Limited surface flora is cultivated in controlled crystal-lit chambers.  
* Fauna is largely excluded; most animals are considered unpredictable.  
* Root-based organisms and fungi are tolerated if they stabilize stone structures.  
* The Deepstone Cities actively remove invasive bioluminescent growth.

10\. Inter-Tribal Relations

* Neutral but distant relations with surface cultures.  
* Trade occurs through controlled tunnels and intermediaries.  
* The Lantern Keepers are tolerated but distrusted.  
* The Sunbound are viewed as irrational and dangerous idealists.

11\. Art, Language & Expression

* Art is geometric, precise, and often functional.  
* Music is rare and extremely subdued, focused on resonance rather than melody.  
* History is recorded through crystal etchings and pressure-marked stone tablets.  
* Spoken language is clipped, formal, and low-volume.

12\. Taboos & Laws

* Waste of energy is the gravest offense.  
* Unauthorized crystal extraction is forbidden.  
* Emotional outbursts in public spaces are punished.  
* Surface nostalgia is discouraged and sometimes censored.

13\. Cultural Psychology

* Values control over expression.  
* Fear chaos, unpredictability, and surface instability.  
* Comforted by repetition and architectural symmetry.  
* Grief is processed privately, never publicly.

14\. Narrative Role

* Represent adaptation through control rather than hope.  
* Contrast surface cultures’ emotional volatility.  
* Pose the moral question: *Is survival without feeling still living?*  
* Serve as gatekeepers of ancient knowledge and technology.

15\. Iconic Details

* Constant faint crystal hum beneath the city.  
* Citizens pause instinctively when a crystal flicker changes.  
* No visible clocks; time is measured through crystal cycles.  
* Visitors often feel watched, not by people, but by the walls themselves.

#### The Bloodless Forest Kin (Tree Beings) (expanding) {#the-bloodless-forest-kin-(tree-beings)-(expanding)}

1\. Core Identity

* **Name:**  
   Common Name: *The Bloodless Forest Kin*  
   Self-Name: *Tharnai* (“Those Who Grow Together”)  
* **Species:**  
   Arboreal humanoids; plant-based, fungal-symbiotic lifeforms.  
* **Population:**  
   Unknown and uncounted. Individuals are not measured numerically, as the Kin consider themselves extensions of a single forest system.  
* **Settlement Pattern:**  
   Semi-nomadic within fixed forests; individuals rarely leave their rooted territories.

2\. Origin & History

* According to Kin tradition, they existed before the Stilling, but were forced to change afterward.  
* They claim the forests “tightened their grip on life” when the sun froze, and the Kin adapted alongside them.  
* There is no linear history; knowledge is stored in layered markings and living root-networks rather than chronology.  
* Past events are understood spatially, not temporally, *where* something happened matters more than *when*.


3\. Environment & Territory

* **Primary Biomes:**  
   Glowforest Expanse, older forest regions bordering the Breathing Marsh.  
* **Territorial Structure:**  
   Forests are divided into **memory zones**, each containing symbolic markings tied to shared knowledge.  
* **Environmental Threats:**  
   Overharvesting, invasive crystal growth, fire, excessive sound, and soil poisoning.

4\. Physical Adaptation & Appearance

* Bodies are composed of layered bark, fibrous muscle analogs, and flexible branch-like limbs.  
* Facial features are minimal and vary by individual; eyes are often replaced by hollow glow-nodes.  
* Movement is slow but deliberate, accompanied by creaks and soft rustling.  
* Limbs may root into the ground during rest or rituals.  
  

5\. Social Structure

* No hierarchy or leaders.  
* Decisions emerge through collective ritual consensus.  
* Knowledge is shared rather than owned.  
* Individual identity exists but is secondary to the forest’s continuity.

6\. Belief System & Worldview

* The forest is a living memory.  
* The sun is not worshipped; it is seen as a distant ancestor that abandoned movement.  
* Change is natural but must be slow and deliberate.  
* Death is a redistribution, not an ending.

7\. Rituals & Traditions

* Daily Root Communion, where Kin connect roots to exchange nutrients and information.  
* Seasonal bark-carving rituals that record significant events.  
* Silent mourning periods where entire forest sections dim their glow.  
* Intrusive sounds during rituals are considered deeply harmful.

8\. Technology & Survival Practices

The Bloodless Forest Kin use no manufactured technology in the conventional sense. Their survival depends on biological processes, ritual knowledge, and long-term coexistence with their environment rather than tools.

* **Essential “tools”:**  
  * Living root networks used for nutrient exchange  
  * Bark-carving implements grown from hardened sap  
  * Fungal growths cultivated to regulate soil health and light  
* **Light:**  
  They do not create light artificially. Instead, they guide and nurture naturally bioluminescent plants, adjusting forest glow through pruning, positioning, and ritual growth patterns.  
* **Water:**  
  Moisture is absorbed directly through roots or shared via underground fungal systems. Wellsap Vines are tolerated but never harvested aggressively.  
* **Food & Preservation:**  
  They do not store food. Nutrients are slowly exchanged and redistributed across the forest, making hoarding unnecessary and taboo.  
* **Reliance:**  
  Entirely plant- and fungal-based systems.  
* **Feared or Refused Technology:**  
  Fire, mining tools, artificial light sources, and sound-amplifying devices. These are believed to “scar the memory of the land.”

9\. Relationship with Flora & Fauna

The Forest Kin see themselves as caretakers, not owners, of the ecosystem.

* **Sacred plants:**  
   Pulse Moss, Graveblossoms, and Memory Reeds

* **Feared plants:**  
   Sweetbreath Traps (considered deceptive spirits rather than plants)  
* **Exploited plants:**  
   None; all harvesting is ceremonial and minimal  
* **Animals:**  
  * Small fauna are considered *forest messengers*  
  * Predators are tolerated unless they disrupt balance  
  * Rootleeches are viewed as necessary parasites  
* **Domestication:**  
  None. Instead, they maintain **symbiotic coexistence**.  
* **Ecological Balance:**  
  Population is self-limiting. If a forest weakens, Kin may deliberately allow parts of themselves to die and re-enter the soil.

10\. Inter-Tribal Relations

* **Allies:**  
  Lantern Keepers (low-impact travelers)  
* **Distrusted:**  
  Deepstone Cities (stone extraction)  
* **Feared:**  
  The Sunbound (obsession with change and brightness)  
* **Conflicts:**  
  Arise from deforestation, overharvesting, or crystal mining near roots.  
* **Trade:**  
  Rare and indirect. Knowledge may be exchanged through marked paths rather than goods.  
* **Misconceptions:**  
  Many believe the Kin are hostile, emotionless, or plant-controlled. In truth, they are cautious and slow to judge.

11\. Art, Language & Expression

* **Art Forms:**  
   Bark carvings, root-pattern arrangements, glow modulation of plants  
* **Primary Medium:**  
   Symbols and living memory over visuals or sound.  
* **Historical Records:**  
   Stored in layered carvings and chemical signals within roots.  
* **Language:**  
   Sparse, slow, and largely symbolic. Darkness is reflected through long pauses and indirect meaning.

12\. Taboos & Laws

* Lighting fire within forest bounds  
* Cutting living trees without ritual consent  
* Extracting nutrients for personal gain  
* Loud, uncontrolled sound

Punishment is not violent. Offenders are cut off from root networks, a form of social and physiological exile.

13\. Cultural Psychology

* **Deepest fears:**  
   Sudden change, fire, artificial light  
* **Comfort:**  
   Stillness, rootedness, shared silence  
* **Coping with loss:**  
   Absorption back into soil, memory-sharing rituals

They value:

* Adaptability  
* Faith in cycles  
* Communal continuity  
* They reject control and domination.

14\. Narrative Role  
The Bloodless Forest Kin represent adaptation through restraint.

* They contrast with extraction-based civilizations.  
* They embody the moral question:  
   *Is survival about growth, or about knowing when to stop?*

Possible roles:

* Silent guides  
* Moral mirrors  
* Guardians of forgotten truths

15\. Iconic Details

* **Symbol:**   
  Intertwined roots forming an open circle  
* **Greeting:**  
  Touching roots to ground simultaneously  
* **Recognizable object:**  
  Living bark-tokens that slowly regrow symbols  
* **Rumor:**  
  Forests where the Kin vanished still respond to footsteps.


#### 

#### The Glass Maskers (expanding) {#the-glass-maskers-(expanding)}

1\. Core Identity

* **Name (outsiders):** The Glass Maskers  
* **Self-name:** *Vael-Thren* — roughly translating to *“Those Who Breathe Carefully”*  
* **Species:** Human, culturally and technologically altered  
* **Population size:** Small and declining; estimated a few thousand spread across multiple regions  
* **Lifestyle:** Semi-nomadic. They establish temporary settlements near resin-producing flora and move once resources begin to thin or contamination risk increases.

At a glance, Glass Maskers are quiet, cautious humans defined by their transparent plant-grown masks, moving deliberately through hazardous landscapes where unfiltered air is often lethal.

2\. Origin & History

* They believe they emerged after the Stilling, born from the first generations that survived mass spore blooms and toxic atmospheric shifts.  
* Their origin myth claims the land itself “taught humans how to breathe again” by offering resin plants that hardened into protective shells.  
* During the initial collapse after the sun weakened, many groups suffocated or went mad from sweet-smelling trap flora. The Maskers survived by sealing their air.  
* Their defining trauma is known as The Unmasked Year, when early attempts to live freely led to widespread death.  
* Their calendar begins with the first successful cultivation of living masks, called Year of the First Seal

3\. Environment & Territory  
**Biomes:**

* Spore-heavy forests  
* Marsh edges  
* Ruined lowland cities overtaken by flora

They stay because rare resin plants required for mask growth only thrive in these dangerous zones.

Daily threats include airborne toxins, hallucinogenic spores, predatory flora, and sudden shifts in bioluminescent emissions.

**Abundant resources:** Resin plants, fungi, Wellsap Vines  
**Scarce resources:** Clean air pockets, uncontaminated soil, safe open water  
Navigation relies on mapped airflow currents, glowing plant markers, and silent hand signals rather than sound.

4\. Physical Adaptation & Appearance  
Adaptation is primarily **technological and cultural**, not biological.  
Clothing is layered, sealed, and soft-edged: woven fibers, treated bark, resin-coated fabrics.  
Masks are transparent, smooth, and grown directly from plant molds shaped to the wearer’s face.  
They protect themselves from:

* **Spores:** Multi-layer resin filtration  
* **Darkness:** Minimal bioluminescent tags or reflective markings  
* **Bioluminescent hazards:** Mask tinting and controlled exposure

Status is shown through mask clarity and patterning—older, more experienced Maskers wear masks with complex internal vein structures.

5\. Social Structure

* Society is communal but tightly regulated.  
* Power lies with Breathwardens, individuals trained to detect contamination and judge air safety.  
* Decisions are made through quiet consensus, often communicated via gesture and symbol.  
* Children are raised collectively, with early training focused on breathing discipline and environmental awareness.  
* The elderly and injured are cared for as long as their presence does not endanger air safety; when mask failure becomes inevitable, individuals often choose voluntary isolation.

6\. Belief System & Worldview

* They believe the Stilling was caused by imbalance, human excess disrupting the world’s breath.  
* The sun is seen as distant and unreliable, neither dead nor benevolent.  
* They believe the world is testing, not punishing.  
* Dominant emotions include vigilance, restraint, and quiet hope tempered by realism.

7\. Rituals & Traditions  
Daily rituals include mask inspection, silent breathing synchronization, and air-testing walks.  
Rituals involve:

* **Silence:** Core to all ceremonies  
* **Growth:** Mask regrowth rites  
* **Decay:** Resin return rituals for the dead

Birth is marked by the creation of a child’s first partial mask.

Coming of age occurs when an individual grows and maintains their own full mask.

Death rituals involve dissolving masks back into resin groves.

Removing a mask in shared space is strictly forbidden and considered both sacrilege and murder.

8\. Technology & Survival Practices

* Essential tools: Living masks, spore detectors, resin blades  
* Light: Minimal bioluminescent organisms or dim crystal shards  
* Water: Wellsap Vines and fog collectors  
* Food: Dried fungi sealed in resin pods  
* They rely almost entirely on plants and fungi.  
* They refuse fire-heavy, loud, or metal-based technologies that risk contamination or mask damage.

9\. Relationship with Flora & Fauna

* Sacred plants: Mask-resin flora  
* Feared plants: Sweetbreath Traps, Graveblossoms  
* Animals: Mostly avoided; some glowing insects tolerated as indicators of safe air  
* They do not domesticate animals.  
* Ecological collapse is avoided through strict harvesting limits and constant relocation.

10\. Inter-Tribal Relations

* Allies are rare but include cautious trader groups.  
* They fear fire-using cultures.  
* Conflicts arise over resin plant territories.  
* Trade is conducted silently at marked drop points.  
* Outsiders see them as paranoid; Maskers see others as reckless.

11\. Art, Language & Expression

* Art focuses on resin carving and etched mask designs.  
* Visual expression outweighs sound.  
* History is recorded through layered resin panels.  
* Their language is sparse, precise, and shaped by the need for silence.

12\. Taboos & Laws

* Cracking another’s mask  
* Burning resin plants  
* Speaking loudly near spore fields  
* Entering sealed groves without permission

Punishment is exile, as risk to air safety endangers all.

13\. Cultural Psychology

* Deepest fears: Air failure, unseen contamination  
* Comfort comes from routine and intact seals  
* Loss is processed through ritual dissolution

They value:

* Control  
* Isolation  
* Precision

14\. Narrative Role  
The Glass Maskers represent survival through restraint.

They embody the question:  
How much of yourself must be sealed away to endure?

They can act as:

* Guides  
* Moral counterpoints  
* Survivors who warn against excess

15\. Iconic Details

* Symbol: A sealed circle with branching internal lines  
* Greeting: Forehead-to-mask contact  
* Recognizable object: Half-grown spare masks carried in resin pods  
* Rumor: Removing a Glass Masker’s mask reveals the last breath they ever took

**Other ideas:**

**The Watchers (other idea)**  
 Shadow creatures that live in the deepest unlit spaces.

* Shadow-dwelling entities  
* Instinctively trigger the feeling of being watched  
* Feed on blood, warmth, and fear  
* Believed by some to exist from before the sun stopped\\

**The Lantern Keepers (other idea)**

* Nomadic travelers who bond with glowing creatures  
* Use living light instead of artificial tools  
* Treat bioluminescent animals as partners, not property  
* Prioritize movement, sound, and soft light over permanence

**The Sunbound** **(other idea)**

* Cult devoted to reigniting or restoring the sun  
* Collect and hoard bright or reflective artifacts  
* Worship brightness as sacred and pure  
* Perform rituals using mirrors, lenses, crystals, and fire-like glows

## **6\. LANDSCAPES & REGIONS** {#6.-landscapes-&-regions}

### **Known Biomes** {#known-biomes}

**Glowforest Expanse**  
A sprawling woodland where every surface gives off some amount of glow, soft, shimmering, or pulsing. The canopy above is made of bioluminescent leaves that sway with slow, almost rhythmic motion, creating the illusion of drifting lights in the sky. Most illumination comes from fungal pillars that wrap around tree trunks like spiraling lanterns, their glow fluctuating in steady “breaths.”

Travel through the Glowforest is disorienting; the light refuses to cast shadows, so depth perception is unreliable. Some trees emit faint melodic hums when touched by wind, and many plants react to movement, folding, dimming, or brightening depending on whether they perceive a threat.

Predators hide in plain sight, blending into light patterns. For this reason, the Glowforest is known as both the most beautiful and the most deceptive biome. Its glow is a lure as much as a guide. Old paths shift as pulse moss and root systems subtly reshape the forest floor over time.

**Crystal Hollows**  
These immense caverns span deep beneath the land, formed around natural veins of bioluminescent crystal. Their glow is colder and sharper than forest light, yellowish-white, refracted endlessly through jagged formations. The air here feels still, as sound echoes unnaturally far and lingers longer than expected.

Travelers describe the hollows as “alive,” not because of creatures, but because the crystals themselves seem reactive. Footsteps vibrate through the crystalline ground, causing faint flickers of light that ripple outward. Some areas pulse like a dim heartbeat, aligned with shifts in subterranean pressure.

The Deepstone Cities carve their territory into the edges of the hollows, using the crystal’s natural luminescence and resonant properties. Over-mining is avoided; the crystals are believed to weaken or “go dark” when over-harvested. Cartographers struggle to map the region because tunnels change as root systems from above break through cavern ceilings or growing crystals block passages over time.

**The Pale Ridges**  
These mountain formations appear ghostly white from a distance due to their reflective stone structure. They scatter the dim sky-glow in shifting, silver patterns—making the peaks seem as though they fade in and out of existence depending on one’s angle.

Because of the constant half-light, the ridges lack sharp shadows, making their cliffs and ledges treacherously difficult to judge. Winds that pass through narrow stone gaps produce low, haunting tones. Some groups believe these tones are messages from spirits trapped during the Stilling.

The rock is brittle in some sections and razor-hard in others, often forming natural sigils or crack lines that cultures interpret as omens. The ridges are sparsely vegetated; only hardy Graveblossoms and strands of wellsap roots cling to the stone. The area is avoided by most.

**The Broken Spine**

A jagged chain of ruptured landforms, once a normal mountain range, now fractured during the period following the Stilling. The dark, uplifted stone resembles vertebrae jutting from the earth, giving the region its name. Chasms run between these “bones,” some shallow, others descending into unknown depths filled with fog that never dissipates.

Tremors still shake the Spine on occasion, accompanied by groaning sounds deep underground, as if the earth itself were straining. Travelers must move carefully; Pulse Moss and root networks slowly shift the terrain, widening cracks or covering openings.

Where the rock split, glowing crystal veins are exposed like nerves. They flicker with faint light, providing natural navigation markers but also attracting fauna that feed on or inhabit the irradiant minerals. The Broken Spine is a borderland, harsh, unstable, and often used as a natural barrier between regions.

**The Breathing Marsh**

This wetland is characterized by ground that rises and falls in slow, uneven rhythms caused by massive, interconnected root systems beneath the mud. The effect is unsettling, fields of marshland that seem to “inhale” and “exhale.” Pools of still water shift ever so slightly with each pulse.

Fog clings permanently to the surface, catching the glow of lichen, fungus, and the occasional creature drifting just above the waterline. The marsh emits soft gurgles and pops as gas escapes from shifting mud pockets, sounds that mimic distant voices or footsteps.

Travelers must memorize the breathing pattern of any area they cross. A misstep during a downward “breath” can drop a person waist-deep into hungry root systems or sinkholes. Some sections contain Wellsap Vines that drip drinkable moisture, while others release toxic fumes or lure creatures with faint glimmers of light.

The Breathing Marsh is feared for its unpredictability but valued for its abundance of rare, dangerous plant species and elusive fauna.

## **7\. TECHNOLOGY & SURVIVAL** {#7.-technology-&-survival}

**How life persists in Evershade**  
Technology in Evershade is not about progress or innovation. It is about endurance, restraint, and coexistence with a hostile, reactive world. Most technologies are biological, mineral, or hybrid in nature, shaped to work with the environment rather than against it.

Advanced machinery, combustion, and large-scale extraction largely vanished after the Stilling. What remains are tools that respect the world’s core truth:  
*Everything impacts everything.*

##### Core Survival Constraints {#core-survival-constraints}

All surviving cultures must solve the same fundamental problems:

* Permanent low-light conditions  
* Toxic spores, mists, and hallucinogenic flora  
* Unstable terrain reshaped by root systems and pulse growth  
* Scarce clean water  
* Reactive ecosystems that respond aggressively to disturbance

As a result, survival technology prioritizes:

* Soft light over brightness  
* Filtration over force  
* Sound awareness over vision  
* Sustainability over efficiency

##### Light Technology {#light-technology}

Light is the most valuable resource in Evershade, but also one of the most dangerous.  
Crystal Lanterns

* Source: Bioluminescent crystals from the Crystal Hollows  
* Function: Steady, fuel-less illumination  
* Variants:  
  * Cold white / yellow-white (navigation, mining)  
  * Pale blue (safe zones, rest areas)  
  * Muted violet (ritual use)  
* Limitations:  
  * Crystals dim or “die” if overused or overharvested  
  * Excessive light can attract predators or trigger plant responses  
* World Rule: Bright light equals danger

Light-Farming Systems

* Source: Bioluminescent fungi, insects, and symbiotic organisms  
* Function: Sustainable, low-level ambient light  
* Form:  
  * Cages  
  * Wall-grown colonies  
  * Carried glow-vessels

* Ethics:  
  * Cultivation is preferred over harvesting  
  * Farming fauna (especially intelligent species) is widely taboo

##### Air & Spore Protection {#air-&-spore-protection}

Breathing safely is never guaranteed.

Resin Masks

* Source: Grown from rare plant species  
* Function:  
  * Filter spores  
  * Neutralize sweet-smelling traps  
  * Reduce hallucination exposure  
* Nature: Living organisms bonded to wearers  
* Maintenance: Moisture, Wellsap sap, rest periods  
* Cultural Weight: Damaging a mask is often treated as attempted murder

Environmental Filters

* Resin-lined shelters  
* Spore-absorbing wall growths  
* Fog-breaker vents made from porous stone and root systems

##### Water Collection & Storage {#water-collection-&-storage}

Open water is rare and often unsafe.

**Wellsap Vines**

* Primary hydration source  
* Condense airborne moisture into drinkable liquid  
* Safe and toxic variants coexist  
* Overharvesting causes permanent vine collapse

**Fog & Dew Catchers**

* Resin-coated nets and bone frames  
* Deployed in marshes and forests  
* Require constant monitoring for contamination

##### Tools & Weapons {#tools-&-weapons}

Tools are designed to be:

* Quiet  
* Lightweight  
* Easily repaired  
* Non-sparking

Vine-Blades

* Hardened plant matter  
* Retain residual toxins  
* Used for cutting, not combat when possible

Bone Tools

* Made from scavenged fauna remains  
* Used for:  
  * Knives  
  * Needles  
  * Structural supports  
* Ritual thanks is common before crafting

Crystal Implements

* Used sparingly due to fragility  
* Often dual-purpose (tool \+ light source)

##### Navigation & Wayfinding {#navigation-&-wayfinding}

Without stars, sun movement, or shadows, navigation is an art.  
**Glow Trails**

* Patterns of bioluminescent flora indicate:  
  * Safe paths  
  * Water sources  
  * Dangerous ground  
* Beacon-Tailed Wanderer migrations leave long-lasting luminous traces

**Sound Mapping**

* Tapping tools reveal:  
  * Hollow ground  
  * Caverns  
  * Water pockets  
* Sound carries abnormally far in Evershade, making this a primary sense

**Root & Symbol Marking**

* Exposed roots carved with cultural symbols  
* Indicate:  
  * Direction  
  * Shelter  
  * Danger  
* Symbol systems differ between cultures, leading to misinterpretation

**Crystal Resonance**

* Certain crystals hum or pulse near:  
  * Stable ground  
  * Underground water  
  * Active crystal veins  
* Skilled travelers carry tuning crystals to interpret vibrations

##### Shelter & Settlement Design {#shelter-&-settlement-design}

Structures are built to avoid provoking the land.

* Rounded shapes instead of sharp angles  
* Flexible materials that move with roots  
* Partial burial or integration into terrain  
* Sound-dampening surfaces

Permanent structures are rare aboveground.

##### Forbidden & Lost Technologies {#forbidden-&-lost-technologies}

Many technologies are intentionally abandoned:

* Fire-based industry  
* High-intensity lighting  
* Large-scale mining  
* Metal smelting near living zones  
* Loud mechanical devices

These are believed to:

* Awaken hostile flora and fauna  
* Cause crystal decay  
* Attract Watchers  
* Permanently scar the land

##### Core Survival Philosophy {#core-survival-philosophy}

Across cultures, a shared understanding exists:

* The world is not passive  
* Resources are alive  
* Survival is negotiation, not conquest

Technology in Evershade is not a sign of dominance, but of listening.

## **8\. CULTURAL BELIEFS** {#8.-cultural-beliefs}

Belief in Evershade is not abstract philosophy. It is a survival response to permanent uncertainty. With no sunrise, no sunset, and no visible passage of time, cultures fill the void with meaning to stabilize identity, behavior, and hope.

Most belief systems are not mutually exclusive. Individuals often hold multiple interpretations of the sun at once, shifting depending on fear, comfort, or circumstance.

At the core of nearly all belief is one shared assumption:  
*The Stilling was not random.*

##### The Sun as Meaning {#the-sun-as-meaning}

The sun, once a constant reference point, has become a symbolic object rather than a physical certainty. Its frozen position allows for interpretation without resolution.

**The Sun Is Asleep**  
Belief: The sun is resting, wounded, or conserving strength. It will awaken when the world proves it can endure.  
Psychological Function:

* Encourages patience and restraint  
* Frames survival as a test rather than a punishment

Cultural Expressions:

* Quiet rituals  
* Low-light living  
* Avoidance of excessive brightness  
* Lullabies and soft hums meant to “not wake the sun too early”

Associated Values:  
Acceptance, endurance, harmony

**The Sun Is Dead**  
Belief: The sun died during the Stilling, and the light remaining is only its corpse fading.  
Psychological Function:

* Provides closure  
* Justifies grief and loss  
* Explains why the old world cannot return

Cultural Expressions:

* Mourning rites  
* Funerary symbolism using dim light  
* Emphasis on legacy and memory  
* Preservation of pre-Stilling knowledge

Associated Values:  
Stoicism, remembrance, realism

**The Sun Is Trapped**  
Belief: The sun is imprisoned behind an unseen force, eclipse, or divine barrier.  
Psychological Function:

* Creates purpose and urgency  
* Justifies action, sacrifice, and rebellion

Cultural Expressions:

* Mirror rituals  
* Lens construction  
* Crystal alignment ceremonies  
* Dangerous expeditions to “thin” regions of the sky

Associated Values:  
Hope, defiance, sacrifice

**The Sun Is Watching**  
Belief: The sun is conscious and aware, observing the world in silence.  
Psychological Function:

* Encourages moral behavior  
* Creates internal surveillance  
* Explains fear without visible predators

Cultural Expressions:

* Avoidance of open skies  
* Covered settlements  
* Confessional rituals  
* Laws against “standing too brightly”

Associated Values:  
Caution, obedience, introspection

##### Light as Sacred and Dangerous {#light-as-sacred-and-dangerous}

Light is never neutral.

* Too little light means loss, madness, and death  
* Too much light attracts predators, awakens flora, or provokes Watchers

As a result:

* Soft, indirect light is sacred  
* Sudden brightness is taboo  
* Shadows are distrusted but also feared when absent

Light becomes a moral substance, not just a physical one.

##### Rituals of Time and Continuity {#rituals-of-time-and-continuity}

Without day or night, cultures invent symbolic time:

* Crystal pulse cycles  
* Bioluminescent bloom phases  
* Migration patterns  
* Breathing rhythms of landscapes

Timekeeping becomes ritualized rather than measured.  
Breaking ritual time is often seen as dangerous, not inaccurate.

##### Fear, Comfort, and Psychological Coping {#fear,-comfort,-and-psychological-coping}

Cultural belief helps regulate:

* Anxiety caused by constant twilight  
* Sensory distortion  
* The feeling of being watched

Common coping beliefs include:

* The land remembers kindness  
* Stillness prevents attention  
* Listening keeps one safe  
* Beauty hides danger


##### Shared Superstitions Across Evershade {#shared-superstitions-across-evershade}

These beliefs appear across cultures, regardless of interpretation of the sun:

* Loud sounds travel farther than they should  
* Bright light “calls” things  
* Some places remember the Stilling  
* The world reacts emotionally, not mechanically  
* Silence is safer than movement

##### Belief Conflicts and Tensions {#belief-conflicts-and-tensions}

Beliefs are a source of division:

* Sunbound cultists clash with preservation-focused cultures  
* Light-worshippers are seen as reckless  
* Those who deny meaning entirely are feared as unstable

Conflicts are rarely about truth, but about risk tolerance.

##### Core Worldview Summary {#core-worldview-summary}

Across Evershade, belief systems reflect one shared reality:

* The world changed permanently  
* Survival requires interpretation  
* Meaning is as necessary as food

In a world without dawn, belief becomes direction.
