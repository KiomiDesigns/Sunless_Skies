        <h2>General Rules</h2>
        <p>Animal life adapted aggressively to the perpetual dimness. Most cannot rely on sight anymore. They evolved:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Echolocation</strong> - Using sound to navigate and hunt</li>
            <li><strong>Complex scent reading</strong> - Chemical detection for tracking</li>
            <li><strong>Vibrational sensing</strong> - Detecting movement through ground or air</li>
            <li><strong>Bioluminescent communication</strong> - Light signals for mates or warnings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Eyes are often vestigial, replaced by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Heat pits</strong> - Thermal detection organs</li>
            <li><strong>Sound chambers</strong> - Enhanced auditory structures</li>
            <li><strong>Whisker-like sensors</strong> - Tactile detection</li>
            <li><strong>Hardened echolocation plates</strong> - Specialized sound-producing organs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Known Fauna (Detailed)</h2>
        
        <h3>Bulbskulls</h3>
        <img src="My documents/Images/Bulbskulls.png" alt="Bulbskulls" style="width:250px; float:right; margin:10px;">
        <p><em>Cranolumen vesica</em></p>
        <p><strong>Species Type:</strong> Fungal-symbiotic, mammal-like microfauna</p>
        
        <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Small creatures standing roughly 15–20 cm tall with soft, compact bodies and thin limbs supporting an oversized, translucent skull. The skull is dome-shaped and glassy, filled with faintly glowing fluid and delicate internal filaments—used as a biological storage tank for water, fat, and nutrients.</p>
        
        <p>Their skin is smooth and semi-gelatinous, ranging from warm amber to pale peach. The skull's surface refracts light, giving the impression of a living lantern in motion. Their eyes are large, glossy black, adapted for low-light detection rather than detail. Symbiotic fungal nodules grow along their limbs and spine.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Glowforest Expanse, The Breathing Marsh, decaying woodland near Graveblossom groves, shaded ruins overgrown with fungus. Shelter in hollow logs, root clusters, fungal mats, and beneath <a href="flora.html">Wellsap Vine</a> canopies, and inside deadwood cavities. Localized and non-migratory, with small territories centered around stable food and moisture sources.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Climate Tolerance:</strong> Highly tolerant of damp, spore-heavy air and low temperatures. Poor tolerance for heat or sudden brightness.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Function:</strong> Omnivorous scavenger feeding on fungal spores, decaying plant matter, sap droplets from <a href="flora.html">Wellsap Vines</a>, and ambient bioluminescent radiation absorbed through the skull. Slow and efficient metabolism allows them to enter dormant states lasting weeks by relying on stored fluids and nutrients.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Life Cycle:</strong> Born soft-shelled with opaque skulls. Skull gradually clears and hardens with age. Lifespan: 12–18 years. Sexual reproduction with small live births; offspring cling to adults until their skulls partially form.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Senses & Communication:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Light sensitivity (low-spectrum); eyes detect motion and glow rather than shape</li>
            <li>Vibration sensing through limbs</li>
            <li>Chemical sensing via moist skin</li>
            <li>Communication through soft clicking sounds, slow pulsing of internal glow, and subtle posture shifts</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Behavior:</strong> Non-aggressive. Freeze response mimicking inert flora, glow suppression to avoid detection. When threatened: Freeze → hide → flee (never fight). Can flash the skull contents with a quick burst of light to stun small predators or alert their colony.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Defense Mechanisms:</strong> Freeze response, glow suppression, and mild numbing secretion if handled.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Predators:</strong> Marsh stalkers, root-burrowers, glow-hunting avians</p>
        
        <p><strong>Flora Interaction:</strong> Strong dietary dependence on fungi, <a href="flora.html">Graveblossoms</a>, and <a href="flora.html">Wellsap Vine</a> byproducts. Spread fungal spores through movement and encourage Graveblossom growth in deadwood by nutrient cycling. Help regulate fungal overgrowth and promote balanced decay cycles.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Ecological Role:</strong> Prey species and keystone recycler. Some predators evolved glow-filtering vision specifically to hunt Bulbskulls.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Sensory Presence (Human Perspective):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sound:</strong> Faint liquid shifting and soft clicking, almost like cooling crystal</li>
            <li><strong>Smell:</strong> Neutral to slightly sweet, with a damp, mineral undertone</li>
            <li><strong>Visual:</strong> Warm amber glow, slow breathing-like pulses, gentle light refraction</li>
            <li><strong>Touch:</strong> Cool, soft, slightly slick, with a fragile, glass-like skull surface</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Cultural Significance:</strong> Believed to store "leftover light" from before the Stilling. Some cultures claim harming one causes light to permanently fade from the area. Killing one is taboo in many settlements. Avoided, observed, occasionally protected. Symbolizes fragile survival, stored hope, and quiet endurance.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Narrative Role:</strong> Environmental indicator and emotional anchor. Often found near ancient ruins, forgotten paths, or places where life narrowly endured the Stilling. Their presence signals a stable but delicate ecosystem—safety that can be lost if disturbed.</p>
        
        <h3>Whisperbats</h3>
        <img src="My documents/Images/Whisperbats.png" alt="Whisperbats" style="width:250px; float:right; margin:10px;">
        <p><em>Noctivox membranis</em></p>
        <p><strong>Species Type:</strong> Mammal-like, chiropteran (bat-derived)</p>
        
        <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Small to medium-sized creatures (roughly the size of a large cat) with compact, muscular bodies covered in dense, charcoal-black fur with a slightly bristled texture. Their skin appears leathery beneath the fur, especially along joints and wing membranes.</p>
        
        <p>Their most striking feature is their oversized ears—tall, veined, and translucent amber-brown, constantly twitching and subtly rotating to track sound. Their wings are leathery and dark, folded tightly against their sides when perched, blending almost seamlessly into their silhouette.</p>
        
        <p>Their eyes are large and almond-shaped, glowing a muted yellow-green in low light. Claws are long, curved, and adapted for gripping bark, stone, or bone-like surfaces. Fine facial whiskers provide vibration sensing.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Glowforest Expanse, ruined woodlands, cave mouths and collapsed structures, Graveblossom groves. Shelter in hollow trees, cliff crevices, ruined arches, and fungal-overgrown caverns. Localized but wide-ranging within territories. Highly territorial around nesting sites.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Climate Tolerance:</strong> Thrives in cold, damp, and fog-heavy environments. Highly sensitive to sudden heat or dry air.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Function:</strong> Carnivorous insectivore / small-fauna hunter feeding on spore-feeders, small scavenger creatures, and insect-like glow fauna. Fast bursts of activity followed by long resting periods.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Life Cycle:</strong> Live birth. Juveniles cling to parents' backs for several weeks. Lifespan: 10–14 years. Sexual reproduction with low birth rate (usually one offspring at a time).</p>
        
        <p><strong>Senses & Communication:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Primary sense is echolocation—clicks are extremely quiet, often inaudible to humans</li>
            <li>Vibration sensing through wing membranes</li>
            <li>Low-light vision (secondary to sound)</li>
            <li>Communication through subsonic chirps, wing membrane vibrations, and ear posture with tail flicks</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Behavior:</strong> Vision is secondary; sound defines space. Their echolocation is so refined they can navigate pitch-black caves, abandoned cities, and root tunnels. Precision strikes using claws and disorienting echo-bursts in enclosed spaces.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Defense Mechanisms:</strong> Camouflage through stillness, sound-dampening fur, sudden silence (halts echolocation entirely when threatened)</p>
        
        <p><strong>Threat Response:</strong> Freeze → confuse with sound → retreat vertically</p>
        
        <p><strong>Predators:</strong> Larger marsh hunters, crystal-backed avians</p>
        
        <p><strong>Flora Interaction:</strong> Indirect dietary dependence; relies on fauna supported by fungal and bioluminescent ecosystems. Often roosts near <a href="flora.html">Graveblossoms</a>—their droppings enrich deadwood, encouraging blossom growth. This creates a symbiotic relationship between predator and plant. Controls overpopulation of spore-feeding insects.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Ecological Role:</strong> Mid-level predator. Competes with other nocturnal hunters and cave-dwellers. Some prey species evolved sound-diffusing body structures to evade Whisperbat detection.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Sensory Presence (Human Perspective):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sound:</strong> Almost none. Occasionally a faint clicking or a pressure-like hum in enclosed spaces</li>
            <li><strong>Smell:</strong> Dry leather and damp bark</li>
            <li><strong>Visual:</strong> Still silhouettes, sudden wing unfurling, reflective eyes in darkness</li>
            <li><strong>Touch:</strong> Warm fur, taut wing membrane, sharp hooked claws</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Cultural Significance:</strong> Seen as watchers of forgotten places. Some believe Whisperbats remember sounds from before the Stilling and replay them in ruins. Avoided rather than hunted. Killing one is believed to "wake the forest." Symbolizes memory, silence, and unseen witnesses.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Narrative Role:</strong> Atmospheric tension creature and environmental signal. Often found near abandoned settlements or places where sound once mattered—markets, temples, halls. Their presence suggests the land is listening. Silence becomes dangerous.</p>
        
        <h3>Beacon-Tailed</h3>
        <img src="My documents/Images/Beacon-Tailed.png" alt="Beacon-Tailed" style="width:350px; float:right; margin:10px;">
        <p><em>Luminocauda errans</em></p>
        <p><strong>Species Type:</strong> Reptilian–mammalian hybrid (serpentine body with mammalian traits)</p>
        
        <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Long, low-bodied creatures ranging from 1.5 to 3 meters in length. Their bodies resemble a fusion of lizard and eel: muscular, flexible, and close to the ground. Skin texture varies between smooth, rubbery scales along the belly and slightly ridged, matte plates along the spine.</p>
        
        <p>Their coloration is muted to avoid detection—ashen grey, moss-green, or deep charcoal—but this dull palette sharply contrasts with their most defining feature: a segmented, bioluminescent tail that glows vividly in bands of cyan, pale green, or soft gold. The tail has semi-translucent plates that brighten or dim independently.</p>
        
        <p>The head is wedge-shaped with a blunt snout, small nostrils, and narrow slit-like eyes adapted to low light. Limbs are short but powerful, ending in clawed feet used for traction rather than speed. Thick neck muscles allow sudden defensive turns.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Glowforest Expanse, The Breathing Marsh, The Broken Spine (lower ridges and chasm edges). Nomadic wanderers following long, repeating migration routes that may take years to complete. Temporary dens beneath roots, inside fallen logs, or shallow burrows lined with shed scales.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Climate Tolerance:</strong> Highly adaptable; resistant to damp, cold, and spore-heavy air. Sensitive to extreme dryness.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Function:</strong> Omnivorous scavenger feeding on bioluminescent mosses and fungi, small fauna and carrion, and mineral-rich soil and crystal flakes. Slow and efficient metabolism allows them to survive long periods without food by entering a low-activity state.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Life Cycle:</strong> Eggs laid in warm, sheltered root pockets. Hatchlings remain near nest zones for several cycles. Lifespan: 20–30 years. Low clutch size but high hatchling survival.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Senses & Communication:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vibration sensing through belly scales</li>
            <li>Chemical sensing (tongue-based)</li>
            <li>Low-light vision (minimal; the tail acts as both communication and environmental feedback)</li>
            <li>Communication through tail-light pulses (patterned flashes), ground vibrations through body movement, and low-frequency hisses</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Behavior:</strong> The tail is used for communication and navigation. Different pulse patterns signal warnings, territory claims, or mating readiness.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Defense Mechanisms:</strong> Tail-light shutoff to disappear instantly, sudden blinding flare when threatened, thick hide resistant to minor bites</p>
        
        <p><strong>Offensive Capabilities:</strong> Powerful constricting coils, crushing bite (non-venomous)</p>
        
        <p><strong>Threat Response:</strong> Confuse → blind → flee through terrain too tight for pursuers</p>
        
        <p><strong>Predators:</strong> Large marsh hunters, Hollow Howlers, crystal-backed beasts</p>
        
        <p><strong>Flora Interaction:</strong> Feeds heavily on <a href="flora.html">Pulse Moss</a>, Glowfungus, and Wellsap residue. Migration paths help spread spores and bioluminescent seeds through scale shedding and waste. Over time, their routes become faintly glowing trails, shaping natural pathways used by other fauna and sometimes humans.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Ecological Role:</strong> Keystone migratory species. They feed on mineral-rich soil near crystal veins, helping to distribute nutrients across biomes. Competes with other scavengers for carrion and glow plants. Some predators evolved light-filtering eyes to counter tail flares.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Sensory Presence (Human Perspective):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sound:</strong> Low scraping of scales, faint tail crackles, deep hissing exhales</li>
            <li><strong>Smell:</strong> Earthy, mineral-rich, faintly metallic</li>
            <li><strong>Visual:</strong> Slow-moving bands of light drifting through fog or forest undergrowth</li>
            <li><strong>Touch:</strong> Cool, heavy body; smooth belly scales; tail plates warm to the touch</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Cultural Significance:</strong> Often believed to be guides left behind by the world itself. Some cultures say they remember safe paths from before the Stilling. Not hunted. Following one is considered risky but sometimes lifesaving. Symbolizes journey, endurance, and fragile guidance.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Narrative Role:</strong> Environmental guide and moral choice. Often appear near shifting terrain, unstable regions, or hidden passages. A glowing trail may signal safety or lead travelers deeper into danger, depending on whether they trust light blindly.</p>
