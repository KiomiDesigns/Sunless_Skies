        <h2>General Rules</h2>
        <p>Most plants that survived or evolved after the Stilling share certain traits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bioluminescent</strong> - Emit their own light in various colors and patterns</li>
            <li><strong>Carnivorous or parasitic</strong> - Actively seek nutrients from other organisms</li>
            <li><strong>Chemical-based feeders</strong> - Rely on chemical processes rather than traditional photosynthesis</li>
            <li><strong>Reactive or "aware"</strong> - Respond to vibration, warmth, and chemical signals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Plants evolved larger leaves and expanded surface areas to capture even the smallest remnants of solar energy. In many cases, light serves more as a signaling mechanism than a food source.</p>
        <p><strong>The world follows a basic truth:</strong></p>
        <blockquote><em>"The more beautiful the plant, the more dangerous it is."</em></blockquote>
        <p>Not all flora is hostile, but most require caution.</p>

        <h2>Detailed Flora</h2>
        
        <h3>Sweetbreath Traps</h3>
        <img src="My documents/Images/Sweetbreath trap.png" alt="Sweetbreath Trap" style="width:250px; float:right; margin:10px;">
        <p><em>Ambrosivora soporis</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> The Sweetbreath Trap takes the form of a tall, elegant flower (about 1 meter tall) rising from a slender, dark stem. Its petals are layered and curved upward like a blooming flame or lotus, colored in deep violet, indigo, and soft magenta hues. The inner petals glow more intensely, fading outward into darker purples at the edges.</p>
        
        <p>Tiny spore-like motes drift constantly around the flower, suspended in the air like fireflies or ash. These particles pulse faintly with light and slowly spiral downward before evaporating. The spores are densest near the bloom and thin out several meters away, creating a visible "aura" around the plant.</p>
        
        <p>The plant's leaves are broad, waxy, and shadow-dark, blending into the forest floor, making the luminous flower appear almost floating.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Growth Pattern:</strong> Perennial. Grows solitary or in loose clusters where air circulation is minimal, allowing spores to linger.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Glowforest Expanse (deep interior zones), sheltered clearings near marsh edges. Grows in soft, damp forest soil rich in fungal networks and decay. Often rooted near fallen trees or old burial sites. Thrives in cool, humid, fog-prone environments with still air.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Function:</strong> Primarily carnivorous with chemical supplementation. The plant produces bioluminescent spores that double as sedative delivery systems. Once prey collapses nearby, root tendrils slowly emerge from beneath the soil to envelop and absorb nutrients. Limited photosynthesis occurs through the glowing petals, but this only sustains basic metabolic functions.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Life Cycle:</strong> Spores settle into nutrient-rich soil and remain dormant until detecting organic decay. Juvenile plants emit faint purple light but no spores. Mature plants release continuous spore clouds. Reproduction occurs after a successful feeding; excess nutrients trigger a spore "bloom surge."</p>
        
        <p><strong>Sensory Experience:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Smell:</strong> Sweet, floral, and soothing, often described as nostalgic or "safe"</li>
            <li><strong>Visual:</strong> A constant slow drift of glowing purple motes, like pollen caught in still air</li>
            <li><strong>Touch:</strong> Petals are warm and faintly vibrating; spores feel like dust but leave a tingling sensation on skin</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Effects:</strong> Emotional comfort, drowsiness, reduced fear and pain perception, mild dreamlike hallucinations, and eventually unconsciousness. Smaller creatures succumb quickly, while larger animals may linger disoriented before collapsing.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Fauna Interaction:</strong> Smaller creatures like <a href="fauna.html">Bulbskulls</a> are particularly vulnerable to the spores. Some predators use Sweetbreath Trap groves as hunting grounds, waiting for weakened prey to collapse near the flowers. Certain species have evolved spore-filtering nasal membranes, aversion to violet light clusters, or ultrasonic warning calls when spores are detected.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Cultural Significance:</strong> Known as <em>"The Dreamer's Bloom"</em> or <em>"The Violet Mercy."</em> Some cultures believe the spores carry fragments of memories from past victims. Carefully harvested spores are used in sleep-inducing tonics and ritual burnings to calm grief-stricken communities, though highly dangerous if inhaled in enclosed spaces. Trade is rare and regulated, controlled by Deepstone alchemists and forbidden in most surface settlements.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> The Sweetbreath Trap represents false peace, seductive beauty, and the danger of surrender in Evershade. Visually, it stands out as one of the most beautiful plants in the world, glowing gently, almost hopeful—reinforcing the core rule: <em>the more beautiful the plant, the more dangerous it is.</em></p>
        
        <h3>Wellsap Vines</h3>
        <img src="My documents/Images/Wellsap Vines.png" alt="Wellsap Vines" style="width:250px; float:right; margin:10px;">
        <p><em>Hydrosiphon lumiligna</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Long, winding strands that cling to trees, stone, ruins, and cave walls like slow-moving veins. Their main body is semi-translucent, pale blue to milky white, with faint hints of green and silver running through it. Inner veins glow softly, pulsing at irregular intervals as moisture moves through the plant.</p>
        
        <p>Along the length of the vine grow bulb-like nodes, about the size of a clenched fist. These nodes are slightly swollen, smooth, and glassy in texture, as if stretched thin from within. When full, they glow brighter and become almost transparent, revealing liquid slowly condensing inside. Over time, droplets form and fall from small pores at the node's base.</p>
        
        <p>The vine's surface feels cool and rubbery, but becomes firmer when cut or stressed. Fine, hair-thin tendrils branch off from the main vine, anchoring it into cracks, bark, or soil. These tendrils often disappear into moss, root systems, or porous stone, making it hard to tell where the plant truly begins or ends.</p>
        
        <p>In still air, Wellsap Vines emit a faint shimmering haze, caused by microscopic moisture particles reflecting their glow. When many vines grow together, the area takes on the appearance of a softly lit, dripping lattice suspended in darkness.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Growth Pattern:</strong> Perennial; slow-growing but expansive once established. Often found in tangled clusters clinging to stone, trees, or ruins.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Glowforest Expanse, The Breathing Marsh, cave entrances near the Crystal Hollows. Prefers humid, fog-heavy environments with slow air movement. Thrives in permanent dim light; excessive brightness causes the vines to retract and stop producing liquid. Anchors into damp soil, rotting wood, or porous stone.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Function:</strong> The vine condenses airborne moisture along translucent veins, slowly channeling it into bulb-like nodes. Uses minimal photosynthesis through faintly glowing leaves and chemical absorption of minerals from surrounding material.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Life Cycle:</strong> Germinates from spores released during periods of high humidity. Young vines attach quickly to nearby surfaces. Mature vines begin producing wellsap nodes after several growth cycles.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Sensory Experience:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sound:</strong> Faint dripping or creaking as nodes fill and release liquid</li>
            <li><strong>Smell:</strong> Clean and mineral-like, sometimes misleadingly fresh</li>
            <li><strong>Bioluminescence:</strong> Pale blue to blue-green with a milky, translucent quality. Slow, uneven pulses following internal moisture flow</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Effects:</strong> Drinking small amounts causes a cooling sensation in the mouth and throat. Repeated consumption of unsafe variants may cause mild dizziness, numbness in extremities, or delayed reactions. Prolonged exposure to dense vine clusters can slightly dull smell perception, making it harder to detect nearby threats.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Defense Mechanisms:</strong> Vines tighten or harden if cut improperly. Some variants produce mildly toxic sap that accumulates over repeated consumption.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Fauna Interaction:</strong> Many species depend on Wellsap for hydration, including <a href="fauna.html">Bulbskulls</a> who shelter beneath vine canopies. Smaller creatures pierce the nodes carefully to drink without poisoning themselves. Larger animals may tear the vines free, often killing the plant. Certain Rootleeches nest inside older vine clusters. Over time, fauna in Wellsap-heavy regions have developed resistance to low-level toxins.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Cultural Significance:</strong> Known as <em>"the patient gift."</em> Myths describe them as remnants of the world's mercy after the Stilling, plants that learned to "hold water" when the skies no longer provided it. Some stories claim the vines were once ordinary roots that adapted out of sympathy for dying creatures.</p>
        
        <p>Among Deepstone City dwellers, Wellsap Vines are believed to listen—it is considered disrespectful to speak loudly or argue near a vine cluster, as this is thought to "spoil" the sap. In marsh cultures, unsafe variants are seen as cursed, deliberately placed by the land to punish greed.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Human Use:</strong> Purified Wellsap is used to cool fevers, treat dehydration, and stabilize crystal sickness. Toxic variants are carefully extracted and diluted to create slow-acting sedatives. Dried vine casings are sometimes woven into talismans or drinking vessels believed to ward off thirst.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Economic Role:</strong> Semi-controlled resource. Safe variants are traded between settlements, marked with braided fiber bands. Entire regions restrict harvesting, as overuse causes vines to wither permanently. Selling untested sap is a severe taboo, punishable by exile.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Wellsap Vines act as a moral test in narratives. Finding one suggests survival is possible, but never guaranteed—reinforcing the world's core rule that beauty and usefulness in Evershade are never without risk.</p>
        
        <h3>Graveblossoms</h3>
        <img src="My documents/Images/Graveblossoms.png" alt="Graveblossoms" style="width:250px; float:right; margin:10px;">
        <p><em>Mortifloris lucens</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Bioluminescent flowering growths that emerge directly from dead or rotting wood rather than soil. They sprout from cracked bark, hollow trunks, exposed roots, and fallen branches, appearing as vivid wounds of light against lifeless timber.</p>
        
        <p>Each blossom resembles a layered, spiral-shaped flower with thick, petal-like growths that curl inward toward a glowing core. The petals are semi-translucent and fibrous, with textures somewhere between wax, fungus, and dried flesh. Their coloration ranges from deep crimson and blood-red to hot pink and soft rose, intensifying toward the center where the glow is strongest.</p>
        
        <p>The light they emit is warm but unsettling—a steady internal radiance rather than a flicker. At night, or in Evershade's constant twilight, the blossoms appear almost ember-like, as if the dead wood itself is smoldering from within. When clustered together, they create the illusion that entire trees are burning slowly without heat or flame.</p>
        
        <p>Graveblossoms often shed faint glowing motes, spore-like particles that drift lazily through the air before fading. These motes settle into cracks in nearby wood, where new growths may later emerge.</p>
        
        <p>The surrounding bark is usually darkened, twisted, or split open, as though the plant has forced its way outward from inside the tree. Over time, heavy infestation causes the wood to become brittle and hollow, riddled with glowing scars.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Growth Pattern:</strong> Perennial. Slow-growing but persistent. Graveblossoms spread gradually through spore release and internal root-like filaments that travel through dead wood. They often appear in clusters, forming glowing trails across fallen forests or old grave sites.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Glowforest Expanse (areas of fallen growth), The Pale Ridges (rotting scaffolds, old shelters), marsh edges and drowned forests, ruins, grave sites, and abandoned settlements. Requires dead wood only—cannot root in soil or stone. Needs active decay and fungal presence. Thrives in cool, damp environments with little air movement; fog-heavy regions accelerate blooming.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Function:</strong> Saprotrophic—feeds on decay rather than light. Breaks down dead organic matter using chemical processes and fungal partnerships.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Life Cycle:</strong> Spores are released when wood reaches advanced decay. Spores settle into cracks in dead material, then filament-like roots spread internally through the wood. Blossoms emerge only once decay is well established. Flowers persist until the host material is fully consumed, then wither and darken.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Symbiosis:</strong> Often grows alongside fungi and pulse moss. Fungal networks help transport nutrients, while Graveblossoms regulate moisture and decay speed.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Sensory Experience:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Smell:</strong> Damp wood, cold air, faint metallic sweetness</li>
            <li><strong>Sound:</strong> Almost silent, though clusters sometimes emit soft crackling as wood collapses</li>
            <li><strong>Touch:</strong> Petals are dry, papery, and fragile; stems feel fibrous and brittle</li>
            <li><strong>Bioluminescence:</strong> Deep red to soft rose, brightest at the center. Slow, irregular brightening and dimming. Individual blossoms do not synchronize, creating uneven, unsettling light</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Effects:</strong> Prolonged exposure can cause melancholy, slowed perception, and heightened awareness of silence. Some report vivid memories surfacing near large clusters.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Defense Mechanisms:</strong> Mild neurotoxic compounds in petals discourage consumption. Light dims when disturbed, camouflaging the plant.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Fauna Interaction:</strong> Primarily a hazard. Most fauna avoid consuming Graveblossoms directly. Attracts insects, scavengers, and spore-feeding creatures but repels large herbivores due to bitterness and toxicity. <a href="fauna.html">Whisperbats</a> often roost near Graveblossom groves, their droppings enriching deadwood and encouraging blossom growth—a symbiotic relationship. <a href="fauna.html">Bulbskulls</a> feed on fungal spores associated with Graveblossoms and help spread nutrients through nutrient cycling. Some insects have adapted to feed exclusively on Graveblossom spores, gaining faint bioluminescence themselves.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Cultural Significance:</strong> Widely known as <em>"death's memory flowers."</em> Many cultures believe they mark places where something important ended—not just lives, but eras, families, or hopes. Some myths claim the flowers bloom brighter where deaths were unjust or forgotten.</p>
        
        <p>Among the Deepstone Cities, Graveblossoms are believed to store echoes of the dead within their glow. In forest cultures, they are considered neutral—not cursed, but never sacred.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Human Use:</strong> Extremely diluted extracts are used as sedatives or to ease end-of-life pain. Blossoms are placed at memorial sites or burned during mourning ceremonies. Pressed petals are used in inks or dyes that faintly glow in darkness.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Economic Role:</strong> Limited and regulated. Harvesting is allowed only from abandoned sites. Taking Graveblossoms from active burial grounds is a serious taboo.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Graveblossoms serve as environmental storytellers. Their presence hints at past catastrophe, forgotten settlements, or silent tragedies. They often mark places where the world "gave up" after the Stilling. Yet they also symbolize quiet persistence—life continuing through decay rather than despite it. Where Graveblossoms bloom, the past is close, watching, and unwilling to fully fade.</p>

        <h2>Other Notable Flora</h2>
        <p><strong>Glassleaf Shrubs</strong> - Transparent leaves that cut skin when brushed against. They refract biolight into beautiful patterns to lure prey.</p>
        <p><strong>Pulse Moss</strong> - A carpet-like moss that expands and contracts like breathing. It can shift the ground over time and slowly swallow fallen objects.</p>
        <p><strong>Memory Reeds</strong> - Tall, thin plants that release faint whispering sounds when touched. Some believe they store echoes of past events.</p>
        <p><strong>Corpse Lanterns</strong> - Fungus that grows on buried skeletons and glows stronger the more bone it touches.</p>
