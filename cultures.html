        <h1>Cultures and Civilization</h1>
        <hr>
        
        <h2>The Fracturing of Humanity</h2>
        <p>Most of civilization disappeared after the Stilling. The small groups that were left split up and found their own ways of surviving this world.</p>
        
        <p>When the sun stopped, so did the old world. Cities fell silent as crops withered, water systems failed, and supply chains collapsed. What survived did so in fragments—isolated communities that adapted radically to the new reality.</p>
        
        <p>Humanity fractured into unique survival cultures. Some embraced light through artificial means; others adapted to darkness or fused with the new bioluminescent ecosystem. Each group developed distinct philosophies, technologies, and beliefs shaped by their environment and the choices they made in the desperate years after the Stilling.</p>
        
        <h2>Intelligent Folk & Entities</h2>
        
        <h4>The Deepstone Cities</h4>
        <img src="My documents/Images/The Deepstone Cities.png" alt="The Deepstone Cities" style="width:250px; float:right; margin:10px;">
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> These civilizations moved underground after the Stilling, shaping entire cities inside stone and crystal formations. They discovered luminescent crystal deposits and learned to harvest and charge them, creating gleaming cities with shifting hues powered by crystal cores.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Architecture:</strong> Their cities are carved with precision from solid rock and reinforced with crystal frameworks, often symmetrical in design. Crystal veins act as natural lighting and energy channels, threading through walls, floors, and ceilings like glowing arteries. The deeper the city, the more refined and brilliant the crystals become.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Culture Values:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Silence</strong> - Communication is often done through subtle gestures and minimal speech. Loud noises are considered wasteful and disruptive</li>
            <li><strong>Control</strong> - Order and structure govern daily life. Everything has its place and purpose</li>
            <li><strong>Energy conservation</strong> - Resources are carefully managed and waste is avoided at all costs</li>
            <li><strong>Predictability</strong> - Routines and traditions maintain stability in an unpredictable world</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Society & Hierarchy:</strong> Social structure is based on depth—those who live and work in the deepest chambers, near the most refined crystals, hold the highest status. Master crystal carvers and light-shapers are revered as both artisans and engineers.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Master craftspeople of crystal lanterns, tools, and weapons. They use carved crystal rods as multi-purpose implements. They have developed sophisticated techniques for harvesting crystals without causing them to "go dark"—a permanent loss of luminescence. Over-mining is strictly forbidden and monitored by city councils.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Relationship with Surface:</strong> Trade crystal lanterns and refined tools with surface communities in exchange for organic materials, food, and information about changing conditions above. Some Deep stone scouts venture to the surface periodically to monitor environmental shifts.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Beliefs:</strong> They believe the crystals are living remnants of the world's light, frozen in stone after the Stilling. Respecting and preserving them is both practical necessity and spiritual duty.</p>
        
        <h4>The Bloodless Forest Kin (Tree Beings)</h4>
        <img src="My documents/Images/The Bloodless Forest Kin.png" alt="The Bloodless Forest Kin" style="width:250px; float:right; margin:10px;">
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Humanoid entities that were grown rather than born. Their bodies consist of bark, woven roots, and jointed branches. They are living extensions of the forest itself, neither fully plant nor fully sentient being, but something in between.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Branch-and-root bodies with bark-like skin that ranges from deep brown to moss-green. Their forms are vaguely humanoid but elongated and asymmetrical—arms may be different lengths, legs may bend at unusual angles. No two Forest Kin look exactly alike, as each grows according to the environment that shaped them.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Biology:</strong> They don't bleed and don't eat in normal ways. Instead, they exchange nutrients through root-like appendages and slow chemical processes. They require little nourishment aside from minerals absorbed from soil and faint light from fungi. Some can root themselves temporarily, drawing sustenance directly from the ground.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Their culture revolves around:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rituals</strong> - Ceremonial practices tied to forest cycles, decay patterns, and seasonal fungal blooms</li>
            <li><strong>Forest markings</strong> - Carved symbols on tree trunks for navigation, communication, and spiritual rites</li>
            <li><strong>Communal knowledge</strong> - Information passed through symbols, physical marks, and root-touch communication</li>
            <li><strong>Minimal needs</strong> - Self-sufficient lifestyle requiring little beyond their forest environment</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Communication:</strong> Forest Kin communicate through carved runes, body language, and a form of chemical signaling transmitted through touching bark or roots. They rarely speak vocally, and when they do, their voices sound like wind through hollow wood.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> They see themselves as caretakers of the forests, not owners. They believe they were created by the forest's will to tend and protect it after humanity failed. Their role is to maintain balance, encourage healthy decay, and discourage invasive growth.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Relationship with Others:</strong> Deeply suspicious of outsiders, especially those who harvest plants carelessly or harm trees. They tolerate respectful travelers but will subtly redirect or disorient those who threaten the forest. Some serve as guides for those who prove themselves worthy.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Beliefs:</strong> They believe all forests are connected through underground root networks and that harming one tree harms the entire forest. Death is not feared—when a Forest Kin falls, they are left to decay and feed new growth.</p>
        
        <h4>The Glass Maskers</h4>
        <img src="My documents/Images/The Glass Maskers.png" alt="The Glass Maskers" style="width:250px; float:right; margin:10px;">
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Humans who survived by bonding with living resin masks grown from rare plants. These transparent masks are not just protective equipment—they are symbiotic organisms essential for survival in the spore-filled, toxin-heavy atmosphere of Evershade.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The Masks:</strong> The masks are semi-translucent, grown from specific plant resins that bond to the wearer's face. Once attached, the mask becomes a living part of the person, filtering toxic air, spores, and sweet-smelling chemical traps like those emitted by Sweetbreath blooms. The masks have fine, root-like tendrils that connect to the wearer's skin, exchanging nutrients and maintaining the bond.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Glass Maskers are often thin and wiry from their nomadic lifestyle. Their faces are partially obscured by the glassy, form-fitting masks that shimmer faintly in bioluminescent light. The masks give them an unsettling, faceless appearance from a distance.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Culture Values:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Highly cautious</strong> - Every action is measured for risk. Carelessness can damage the mask, which means death</li>
            <li><strong>Quiet and survival-focused</strong> - Minimal conversation, maximum awareness. Speaking too much wastes filtered air</li>
            <li><strong>Dependent on rare plants</strong> - Their survival hinges on finding the specific plants needed for mask repair and regrowth</li>
            <li><strong>Self-reliance</strong> - Trust is earned slowly; relying on others is dangerous</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Mask Maintenance:</strong> The masks are living organisms that must be "fed" with clean moisture (often purified Wellsap) and occasionally regrown if damaged. A damaged mask must be replaced entirely, a process that takes weeks and leaves the person vulnerable. The knowledge of mask cultivation—which plants to use, how to bond them, how to maintain them—is closely guarded and passed only to trusted members.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Society:</strong> Communities are small and nomadic, constantly moving to find the rare plants needed for mask maintenance. Settlements are temporary, built quickly and abandoned when resources run dry. Social bonds are tight within groups but outsiders are viewed with suspicion.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Taboos:</strong> Damaging someone's mask is equivalent to murder. Stealing mask-making knowledge or the plants required for cultivation is punishable by exile or death. Removing one's mask in public is considered either an act of extreme trust or a death wish.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Relationship with Others:</strong> They trade mask-making services cautiously, sometimes providing temporary protective masks to outsiders in exchange for food, tools, or safe passage. They avoid areas with heavy Sweetbreath Trap presence.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Beliefs:</strong> They believe the masks are gifts from the world itself, a form of mercy granted to those willing to adapt. Some say the first masks grew from the tears of those who survived the Stilling.</p>
        
        <h4>The Watchers</h4>
        <p>Shadow creatures that live in the deepest unlit spaces.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shadow-dwelling entities</li>
            <li>Instinctively trigger the feeling of being watched</li>
            <li>Feed on blood, warmth, and fear</li>
            <li>Believed by some to exist from before the sun stopped</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>The Lantern Keepers</h4>
        <p>Nomadic travelers who bond with glowing creatures.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use living light instead of artificial tools</li>
            <li>Treat bioluminescent animals as partners, not property</li>
            <li>Prioritize movement, sound, and soft light over permanence</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>The Sunbound</h4>
        <p>Cult devoted to reigniting or restoring the sun.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collect and hoard bright or reflective artifacts</li>
            <li>Worship brightness as sacred and pure</li>
            <li>Perform rituals using mirrors, lenses, crystals, and fire-like glows</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cultural Beliefs</h2>
        <h3>Common Myths About the Sun</h3>
        <p>Different cultures have developed their own explanations for the Stilling:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The sun is asleep</strong> - It will wake when the world proves worthy</li>
            <li><strong>The sun is dead</strong> - It gave its last light during the eclipse and cannot return</li>
            <li><strong>The sun is trapped</strong> - Something holds it in place, and it can be freed</li>
            <li><strong>The sun is watching</strong> - It froze deliberately to observe what humanity would become</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Timekeeping After the Stilling</h3>
        <p>With no day/night cycle, timekeeping became a cultural problem. Different groups invented their own measurements based on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Crystal glow cycles</strong> - The natural brightening and dimming of certain crystals</li>
            <li><strong>Bioluminescent plant pulses</strong> - Regular fluctuations in flora like Pulse Moss</li>
            <li><strong>Creature migration patterns</strong> - The predictable movements of species like Beacon-Tailed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This lack of universal time has made coordination between distant groups nearly impossible and has contributed to cultural isolation.</p>
        
        <h3>Taboos and Sacred Practices</h3>
        <p><strong>Widely Shared Taboos:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Harming Bulbskulls (believed to cause light to fade permanently)</li>
            <li>Harvesting Graveblossoms from active burial sites</li>
            <li>Selling untested Wellsap (can lead to exile or worse)</li>
            <li>Killing Whisperbats near ruins (believed to "wake the forest")</li>
            <li>Following Watchers into darkness</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Ritual Practices:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Speaking softly near Wellsap Vines (to avoid "spoiling" the sap)</li>
            <li>Leaving offerings at Graveblossom sites for the forgotten dead</li>
            <li>Burning dried Sweetbreath petals during grief ceremonies</li>
            <li>Marking safe paths with braided fiber bands</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Dividing Line of History</h3>
        <p>All surviving cultures refer to time as either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"Before the Stilling"</strong> - The old world of sun, seasons, and certainty</li>
            <li><strong>"After the Stilling"</strong> - The new world of twilight, adaptation, and survival</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Over centuries, the planet's name changed from Earth to <strong>Evershade</strong>, reflecting the permanent twilight that now defines existence.</p>
